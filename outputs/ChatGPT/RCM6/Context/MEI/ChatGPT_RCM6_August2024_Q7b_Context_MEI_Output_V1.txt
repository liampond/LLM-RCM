### Step 1: Determine the Key of the Piece
#### 1. Check the Key Signature
The key signature in the MEI file is specified as "3s," meaning three sharps. According to the key signature table:
- Three sharps correspond to **A Major** or **F♯ Minor**.

#### 2. Determine if the Key is Major or Minor
To distinguish between A Major and F♯ Minor:
- Look for the raised seventh degree of F♯ Minor (E♯). If present, the key is likely F♯ Minor.
- Analyze the melodic and harmonic content. The melody emphasizes F♯, A, and C♯, which are the tonic, third, and fifth of **F♯ Minor**. Additionally, the presence of E♯ in bar 3 confirms the raised seventh degree of F♯ Minor.

**Key: F♯ Minor**

### Step 2: Determine the Time Signature
#### Analyze the Rhythms in Each Measure
- **Bar 1:**
  - Notes: F♯ (quarter), C♯ (eighth), A (eighth), B (eighth), C♯ (eighth).
  - Total rhythmic value: 1 (quarter) + 0.5 (eighth) + 0.5 (eighth) + 0.5 (eighth) + 0.5 (eighth) = **3 beats**.
  - The beamed eighth notes suggest **compound time**.

- **Bar 2:**
  - Notes: D (quarter), B (eighth), F♯ (eighth), E (eighth), D (eighth).
  - Total rhythmic value: 1 (quarter) + 0.5 (eighth) + 0.5 (eighth) + 0.5 (eighth) + 0.5 (eighth) = **3 beats**.
  - Again, the beamed eighth notes suggest **compound time**.

- **Bar 3:**
  - Notes: C♯ (eighth), D♯ (eighth), E♯ (eighth), G♯ (eighth), F♯ (eighth), E♯ (eighth).
  - Total rhythmic value: 0.5 (eighth) × 6 = **3 beats**.
  - The consistent eighth-note groupings confirm **compound time**.

- **Bar 4:**
  - Notes: F♯ (dotted half note).
  - Total rhythmic value: 1.5 (dotted half) = **3 beats**.
  - The dotted half note fits within **compound time**.

#### Determine the Bottom Number
- Each beat is divided into three smaller beats (eighth notes), so the bottom number is **8**.

#### Write the Time Signature
- There are **3 beats per measure**, and each beat is a dotted quarter note (3 eighth notes).
- **Time Signature: 9/8**

### Step 3: Determine the Root/Quality Chord Symbols
#### Bar 1:
- Notes: F♯, C♯, A, B, C♯.
- Strong beats: F♯ (beat 1), A (beat 2), C♯ (beat 3).
- Chord tones: F♯, A, C♯ form an **F♯ Minor triad**.
- Non-chord tones: B is a passing tone between A and C♯.
- **Chord: F♯ Minor (F♯m)**.

#### Bar 2:
- Notes: D, B, F♯, E, D.
- Strong beats: D (beat 1), F♯ (beat 2), D (beat 3).
- Chord tones: D, F♯, B form a **B Minor triad** (in first inversion: D is the bass).
- Non-chord tones: E is a passing tone between F♯ and D.
- **Chord: B Minor (Bm)**.

#### Bar 3:
- Notes: C♯, D♯, E♯, G♯, F♯, E♯.
- Strong beats: C♯ (beat 1), E♯ (beat 2), F♯ (beat 3).
- Chord tones: C♯, E♯, G♯ form a **C♯ Major triad**.
- Non-chord tones: D♯ is a passing tone between C♯ and E♯.
- **Chord: C♯ Major (C♯)**.

#### Bar 4:
- Notes: F♯ (dotted half note).
- Strong beat: F♯ (sustained throughout the measure).
- Chord tones: F♯ is the root of an **F♯ Minor triad**.
- **Chord: F♯ Minor (F♯m)**.

---

### Final Answer:
- **Key:** F♯ Minor
- **Time Signature:** 9/8
- **Chord Symbols:**
  - Bar 1: F♯m
  - Bar 2: Bm
  - Bar 3: C♯
  - Bar 4: F♯m
