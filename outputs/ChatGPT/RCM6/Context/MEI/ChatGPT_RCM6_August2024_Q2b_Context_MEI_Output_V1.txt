To determine the time signature for the measures in the provided MEI file, we will analyze the rhythmic groupings and their total values step by step.

### Measure 1 Analysis:
1. **Notes and Rhythmic Values**:
   - **First note**: Dotted quarter note (`dur="4"`, `dots="1"`). Value = 1.5 beats.
   - **Second note**: Quarter note (`dur="8"`). Value = 1 beat.
   - **Third beam group**:
     - First note: Sixteenth note (`dur="16"`). Value = 0.25 beats.
     - Second note: Sixteenth note (`dur="16"`). Value = 0.25 beats.
     - Third note: Eighth note (`dur="8"`). Value = 0.5 beats.
     - Total for this beam group = 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.5 = 1 beat.
   - **Fourth beam group**:
     - First note: Eighth note (`dur="8"`). Value = 0.5 beats.
     - Second note: Eighth note (`dur="8"`). Value = 0.5 beats.
     - Total for this beam group = 0.5 + 0.5 = 1 beat.

2. **Total Rhythmic Value**:
   - Dotted quarter note = 1.5 beats.
   - Quarter note = 1 beat.
   - Third beam group = 1 beat.
   - Fourth beam group = 1 beat.
   - Total = 1.5 + 1 + 1 + 1 = **4.5 beats**.

3. **Inference**:
   - The measure does not fit into a simple time signature like 4/4 or 3/4 because the total value is 4.5 beats.
   - This suggests a **compound time signature** where each beat is divided into three smaller beats.
   - The smallest rhythmic unit is a sixteenth note (0.25 beats), so the bottom number is likely 8 (eighth note as the beat unit).
   - The measure contains **three beats of 1.5 each**, so the time signature is **9/8**.

### Measure 2 Analysis:
1. **Notes and Rhythmic Values**:
   - **First beam group**:
     - First note: Sixteenth note (`dur="16"`). Value = 0.25 beats.
     - Second note: Sixteenth note (`dur="16"`). Value = 0.25 beats.
     - Third note: Thirty-second note (`dur="32"`). Value = 0.125 beats.
     - Fourth note: Thirty-second note (`dur="32"`). Value = 0.125 beats.
     - Total for this beam group = 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.125 + 0.125 = 0.75 beats.
   - **Second beam group**:
     - First note: Dotted sixteenth note (`dur="16"`, `dots="1"`). Value = 0.375 beats.
     - Second note: Thirty-second note (`dur="32"`). Value = 0.125 beats.
     - Third note: Sixteenth note (`dur="16"`). Value = 0.25 beats.
     - Total for this beam group = 0.375 + 0.125 + 0.25 = 0.75 beats.
   - **Third beam group**:
     - First note: Eighth note (`dur="8"`). Value = 0.5 beats.
     - Second note: Sixteenth note (`dur="16"`). Value = 0.25 beats.
     - Total for this beam group = 0.5 + 0.25 = 0.75 beats.

2. **Total Rhythmic Value**:
   - First beam group = 0.75 beats.
   - Second beam group = 0.75 beats.
   - Third beam group = 0.75 beats.
   - Total = 0.75 + 0.75 + 0.75 = **2.25 beats**.

3. **Inference**:
   - The measure does not fit into a simple time signature because the total value is 2.25 beats.
   - This suggests a **compound time signature** where each beat is divided into three smaller beats.
   - The smallest rhythmic unit is a sixteenth note (0.25 beats), so the bottom number is likely 8 (eighth note as the beat unit).
   - The measure contains **three beats of 0.75 each**, so the time signature is **9/8**.

### Final Answer:
- **Measure 1**: The time signature is **9/8**.
- **Measure 2**: The time signature is **9/8**.
