### Step 1: Determine the Key of the Piece

#### 1. Check the Key Signature
The `<keySig>` element in the MEI file specifies `sig="1s"`, indicating one sharp in the key signature. Referring to the key signature table:
- 1 sharp corresponds to **G Major** or **E Minor**.

#### 2. Determine if the Key is Major or Minor
To distinguish between G Major and E Minor, we look for accidentals that indicate a raised seventh degree (D♯) in E Minor. Examining the notes:
- Measure 1: Notes are G, A, B, C, and A. No accidentals suggest E Minor.
- Measure 2: Notes are B, G, F♯, E, D♯ (with an explicit sharp accidental), and A. The D♯ is the raised seventh degree of E Minor.
- Measure 3: Notes are G, F♯, E, and E. The F♯ is consistent with the key signature, and no new accidentals suggest a change.
- Measure 4: Notes are D♯, C♯, B, and A. The D♯ and C♯ further confirm E Minor.

The presence of D♯ (raised seventh) strongly suggests the piece is in **E Minor**.

#### 3. Look for Other Clues
The melodic and harmonic content, including the emphasis on E Minor triads and the raised seventh degree, supports the conclusion that the key is **E Minor**.

### Step 2: Determine the Time Signature

#### Step 1: Identify the Beat Groupings
We analyze the rhythmic groupings in each measure:

- **Measure 1:**
  - A sixteenth rest (1/16) followed by a beam of five sixteenth notes (5 × 1/16 = 5/16).
  - Total = 1/16 + 5/16 = **6/16**.

- **Measure 2:**
  - A beam of six sixteenth notes (6 × 1/16 = 6/16).
  - Total = **6/16**.

- **Measure 3:**
  - A beam of four notes: two thirty-second notes (2 × 1/32 = 1/16), one sixteenth note (1/16), and one eighth note (2/16). Total = 1/16 + 1/16 + 2/16 = 4/16.
  - A sixteenth rest (1/16).
  - Total = 4/16 + 1/16 = **5/16**.

- **Measure 4:**
  - A beam of four notes: two thirty-second notes (2 × 1/32 = 1/16), one sixteenth note (1/16), and one eighth note (2/16). Total = 1/16 + 1/16 + 2/16 = 4/16.
  - A sixteenth rest (1/16).
  - Total = 4/16 + 1/16 = **5/16**.

#### Step 2: Check the Total Value of the Beam Groupings
- Measures 1 and 2 consistently total **6/16**, suggesting a compound meter.
- Measures 3 and 4 total **5/16**, which is inconsistent with the previous measures. However, this could indicate a change in rhythmic emphasis or an incomplete measure.

#### Step 3: Determine the Bottom Number
The smallest rhythmic value is a sixteenth note (1/16), so the bottom number of the time signature is **16**.

#### Step 4: Count the Total Beats in the Measure
- In Measures 1 and 2, the total rhythmic value is 6/16, suggesting **6 beats per measure**.
- Measures 3 and 4 are incomplete or irregular, but the overall structure suggests a compound meter with **6 beats per measure**.

#### Step 5: Write the Time Signature
The time signature is **6/16**, indicating a compound meter with two beats per measure, each subdivided into three sixteenth notes.

### Summary

- **Key:** The piece is in **E Minor**, as indicated by the key signature (1 sharp) and the presence of D♯ (raised seventh degree).
- **Time Signature:** The inferred time signature is **6/16**, a compound meter with two beats per measure, each subdivided into three sixteenth notes.
