To transpose the melody up a **minor sixth**, we need to raise each note by 8 semitones. The original key signature is **E major (4 sharps: F#, C#, G#, D#)**. Transposing up a minor sixth from E major results in the key of **C minor (3 flats: Bb, Eb, Ab)**. Below is the transposed melody with the correct notes, rhythms, and accidentals.
