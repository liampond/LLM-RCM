### Answers:

1. **Key of the Piece**  
   The key signature has one flat (B♭). Based on Guide 1, this corresponds to either F Major or D Minor. Since there is no raised 7th (C♯) in the melody or harmony to indicate D Minor, the key is **F Major**.

2. **Time Signature**  
   The rhythmic groupings in the left hand (e.g., beams of three eighth notes) and the total rhythmic value of each measure (6 eighth notes) suggest a compound meter. Each beat is a dotted quarter note (3 eighth notes), and there are two beats per measure. Therefore, the time signature is **6/8**.

3. **Chord Outlined by the First Three Eighth Notes of Bar 2 (Both Hands)**  
   The notes in the right hand are D, B♭, and D, while the left hand plays F, B♭, and D. In the key of F Major, these notes (B♭, D, F) form a **B♭ major triad**, which is the subdominant (IV) chord.  
   **Answer: Subdominant triad.**

4. **Interval Between the Last Eighth Note in the Left Hand of Bar 2 and the First Note in the Left Hand of Bar 3**  
   The last eighth note in the left hand of bar 2 is D (octave 4), and the first note in the left hand of bar 3 is E (octave 3). Counting the letter names: D (1), E (2). This is a **second**.  
   Comparing the pitches, D to E is a whole step, making it a **Major second**.  
   **Answer: Major second.**

5. **Functional Chord Symbol for the First Three Eighth Notes of Bar 5 (Both Hands)**  
   The notes in the right hand are F, A, and C, while the left hand plays F, A, and C. These notes form an **F major triad**, which is the tonic (I) chord in the key of F Major.  
   **Answer: I (Tonic).**

6. **Chord Outlined by the Last Three Eighth Notes of Bar 7 (Both Hands)**  
   The notes in the right hand are B♭, G, and E, while the left hand plays C, G, and E. In the key of F Major, these notes (E, G, B♭) form an **E diminished triad**, which is the leading-tone (vii°) chord.  
   **Answer: Leading-tone diminished triad (vii°).**

7. **Interval Between the Second Eighth Note in the Left Hand of Bar 8 and the Third Eighth Note in the Left Hand of Bar 8**  
   The second eighth note in the left hand of bar 8 is E, and the third eighth note is B♭. Counting the letter names: E (1), F (2), G (3), A (4), B (5). This is a **fifth**.  
   Comparing the pitches, E to B♭ is 6 semitones, making it a **Diminished fifth**.  
   **Answer: Diminished fifth.**

8. **Rest to Complete Bar 8 in the Right Hand**  
   The right hand ends with a dotted quarter note (F) in bar 8. Since the time signature is 6/8, the measure requires 6 eighth notes in total. A dotted quarter note equals 3 eighth notes, leaving 3 eighth notes unaccounted for. Therefore, a **dotted quarter rest** is needed to complete the bar.  
   **Answer: Dotted quarter rest.**

9. **Parallel or Contrasting Period**  
   The antecedent and consequent phrases begin with similar melodic material, as seen in the repetition of thematic ideas in the right hand. This indicates a **parallel period**.  
   **Answer: Parallel period.**

10. **Meaning of Allegretto Vivace**  
    "Allegretto" indicates a moderately fast tempo, slightly slower than Allegro. "Vivace" means lively or spirited. Together, "Allegretto vivace" suggests a **moderately fast and lively tempo**.  
    **Answer: Moderately fast and lively.**
