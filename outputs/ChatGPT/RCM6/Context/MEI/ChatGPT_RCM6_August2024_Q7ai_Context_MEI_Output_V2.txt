### Step 1: Determine the Key of the Piece

#### 1. Check the Key Signature
The `<keySig>` element in the MEI file specifies `sig="1s"`, indicating one sharp in the key signature. Referring to the key signature table:
- 1 sharp corresponds to **G Major** or **E Minor**.

#### 2. Determine if the Key is Major or Minor
To distinguish between G Major and E Minor, we look for the raised seventh degree of E Minor (D♯). If present, the key is E Minor; otherwise, it is likely G Major.

- In the provided MEI file, there is no D♯ (raised seventh of E Minor) present in the notes. Instead, the notes emphasize G, B, and D, which form the tonic triad of G Major.
- Therefore, the key is **G Major**.

### Step 2: Determine the Time Signature

#### Step 1: Identify the Beat Groupings
We analyze the rhythmic groupings in each measure to infer the time signature.

##### Measure 0
- Contains a single note: a sixteenth note (`dur="16"`). This measure is likely a pickup measure and does not provide enough information about the time signature.

##### Measure 1
- The notes are grouped into four beams, each containing three sixteenth notes:
  - Beam 1: G (16th), B (16th), F♯ (16th).
  - Beam 2: G (16th), B (16th), D (16th).
  - Beam 3: G (16th), B (16th), F♯ (16th).
  - Beam 4: G (16th), B (16th), D (16th).
- Each beam grouping totals 3 sixteenth notes, or 0.75 beats in compound time.

##### Measure 2
- The notes are grouped into four beams, each containing three sixteenth notes, except for the final note:
  - Beam 1: E (16th), C (16th), G (16th).
  - Beam 2: G (eighth note, `dur="8"`), C (16th).
  - Beam 3: D (16th), B (16th), G (16th).
  - Final note: G (eighth note, `dur="8"`).
- The first three beams each total 0.75 beats (compound time), and the final eighth note adds 0.5 beats.

#### Step 2: Check the Total Value of the Beam Groupings
- In Measure 1, there are four beam groupings, each totaling 0.75 beats. The total value is:
  - \( 0.75 \times 4 = 3 \) beats.
- In Measure 2, the first three beams total \( 0.75 \times 3 = 2.25 \) beats, and the final eighth note adds 0.5 beats. The total value is:
  - \( 2.25 + 0.5 = 2.75 \) beats.
  - This suggests that Measure 2 is incomplete, likely ending with a double barline.

#### Step 3: Determine the Bottom Number
- Each smaller beat is a sixteenth note, so the bottom number of the time signature is **16**.

#### Step 4: Count the Total Beats in the Measure
- In Measure 1, there are 12 sixteenth notes in total (4 groupings of 3 sixteenth notes each). This suggests a compound meter with 12 smaller beats per measure.
- The top number of the time signature is **12**.

#### Step 5: Write the Time Signature
- Combine the top number (12 beats) with the bottom number (16th note as the beat unit). The time signature is:
  - **12/16**.

### Summary
- **Key**: G Major
- **Time Signature**: 12/16
