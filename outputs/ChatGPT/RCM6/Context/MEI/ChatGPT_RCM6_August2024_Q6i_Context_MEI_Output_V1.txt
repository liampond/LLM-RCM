### Step-by-Step Analysis:

#### 1. **Key of the Melody**
- The key signature in the MEI file indicates **3 flats**.
- According to the key signature chart, 3 flats correspond to **E♭ major** or **C minor**.
- To determine whether the melody is in E♭ major or C minor, we look for accidentals and harmonic/melodic clues:
  - The melody contains **B♮** (natural) in several places, which is the raised 7th degree in C minor.
  - This suggests the piece is in **C minor** (not E♭ major).

**Key:** C minor

#### 2. **Root/Quality Chord Symbol of the Second Last Chord**
- The second last chord is in **measure 4**, staff 1, layer 1:
  - Notes: **G (bass), B♮, D**.
- Step-by-step:
  1. **Root:** The bass note is **G**, so the root is **G**.
  2. **Quality:**
     - The third above G is **B♮** (4 half steps → major third).
     - The fifth above G is **D** (7 half steps → perfect fifth).
     - This forms a **G major triad**.
- **Chord Symbol:** G

#### 3. **Root/Quality Chord Symbol of the Last Chord**
- The last chord is in **measure 4**, staff 1, layer 1:
  - Notes: **G (bass), B♮, D** (same as the second last chord).
- Step-by-step:
  1. **Root:** The bass note is **G**, so the root is **G**.
  2. **Quality:**
     - The third above G is **B♮** (4 half steps → major third).
     - The fifth above G is **D** (7 half steps → perfect fifth).
     - This forms a **G major triad**.
- **Chord Symbol:** G

#### 4. **Functional Chord Symbol for the Second Last Chord**
- In the key of **C minor**, the root of the second last chord is **G**.
- G is the **5th scale degree** in C minor.
- The chord is a **major triad**, so it is a **V chord**.
- **Functional Chord Symbol:** V

---

#### 5. **Functional Chord Symbol for the Last Chord**
- The last chord is identical to the second last chord:
  - Root: **G**.
  - Quality: **Major triad**.
- In the key of **C minor**, this is also a **V chord**.
- **Functional Chord Symbol:** V

---

#### 6. **Type of Cadence**
- The final chord is **V (G major)**, not the tonic (i in C minor).
- A cadence ending on the dominant (V) is a **half cadence**.
- **Cadence Type:** Half
