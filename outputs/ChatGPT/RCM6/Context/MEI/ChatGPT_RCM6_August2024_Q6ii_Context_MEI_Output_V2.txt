### Step-by-Step Analysis:

#### 1. **Key of the Melody**
- The key signature in the MEI file indicates **2 sharps**.
- From the guide, 2 sharps correspond to either **D major** or **B minor**.
- To determine whether the key is major or minor, we look for accidentals or harmonic/melodic content:
  - Measure 1 contains a **C♯** (raised 7th in B minor) and a **D** (tonic of D major).
  - Measure 3 contains a **C♯** in the chord, which aligns with **B minor**.
  - The melody emphasizes **B minor triads** and ends on a **B minor chord**.
- **Key: B minor**

#### 2. **Root/Quality Chord Symbol of the Second Last Chord**
- The second last chord is in Measure 4, Staff 1:
  - Notes: **F♯, A, D**.
  - Root: **D** (bass note is D).
  - Third above D: **F♯** (4 half steps → major third).
  - Fifth above D: **A** (7 half steps → perfect fifth).
  - This is a **D major triad**.
- **Root/Quality Chord Symbol: D**

#### 3. **Root/Quality Chord Symbol of the Last Chord**
- The last chord is in Measure 4, Staff 1:
  - Notes: **F♯, A, D** (Staff 1) and **F♯** (Staff 2).
  - Root: **F♯** (bass note is F♯).
  - Third above F♯: **A** (3 half steps → minor third).
  - Fifth above F♯: **D** (6 half steps → diminished fifth).
  - This is an **F♯ diminished triad**.
- **Root/Quality Chord Symbol: F♯dim**

#### 4. **Functional Chord Symbol for the Second Last Chord**
- In the key of **B minor**, the **D major triad** is built on the 6th scale degree.
- Roman numeral: **VI**.
- **Functional Chord Symbol: VI**

---

#### 5. **Functional Chord Symbol for the Last Chord**
- In the key of **B minor**, the **F♯ diminished triad** is built on the 7th scale degree.
- Roman numeral: **vii°**.
- **Functional Chord Symbol: vii°**

---

#### 6. **Type of Cadence**
- The cadence moves from **VI (D major)** to **vii° (F♯ diminished)**.
- The final chord is not the tonic (i), but rather the leading-tone chord (vii°).
- This is a **half cadence**.
- **Type of Cadence: Half**

### Final Answer:
- **Key of the Melody:** B minor  
- **Root/Quality Chord Symbol of the Second Last Chord:** D  
- **Root/Quality Chord Symbol of the Last Chord:** F♯dim  
- **Functional Chord Symbol for the Second Last Chord:** VI  
- **Functional Chord Symbol for the Last Chord:** vii°  
- **Type of Cadence:** Half
