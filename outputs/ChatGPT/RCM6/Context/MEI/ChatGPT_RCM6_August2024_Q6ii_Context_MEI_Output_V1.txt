### Step-by-Step Analysis:

#### 1. **Key of the Melody**
- The key signature in the MEI file is **2 sharps** (`sig="2s"`), which corresponds to either **D major** or **B minor**.
- To determine whether the key is major or minor, we look for accidentals or harmonic/melodic clues:
  - Measure 1 contains a **C♯** (`accid.ges="s"`), which is the leading tone in **D major**.
  - The melody emphasizes **D** and **A**, which are tonic and dominant in **D major**.
- **Key:** **D major**

#### 2. **Root/Quality Chord Symbol of the Second Last Chord**
- The second last chord is in **Measure 4**, Staff 1:
  - Notes: **F♯ (accid.ges="s")**, **A**, and **D**.
  - Root: The bass note is **D**, so the root is **D**.
  - Quality:
    - The third above **D** is **F♯** (4 half steps → major third).
    - The fifth above **D** is **A** (7 half steps → perfect fifth).
    - This is a **D major triad**.
- **Root/Quality Chord Symbol:** **D**

---

#### 3. **Root/Quality Chord Symbol of the Last Chord**
- The last chord is in **Measure 4**, Staff 2:
  - Notes: **F♯ (accid.ges="s")**.
  - Root: The bass note is **F♯**, so the root is **F♯**.
  - Quality:
    - This is a single note, so it is not a full chord. However, it functions as a **F♯ major chord** (implied by the key and context).
- **Root/Quality Chord Symbol:** **F♯**

---

#### 4. **Functional Chord Symbol for the Second Last Chord**
- In the key of **D major**, the chord **D major** is built on the 1st scale degree.
- **Functional Chord Symbol:** **I**

---

#### 5. **Functional Chord Symbol for the Last Chord**
- In the key of **D major**, the chord **F♯ major** is built on the 5th scale degree of the **dominant of the dominant** (secondary dominant).
- **Functional Chord Symbol:** **V/V**

---

#### 6. **Type of Cadence**
- The progression moves from **I (D major)** to **V/V (F♯ major)**.
- The final chord is **V/V**, which is not the tonic.
- This is a **half cadence**.
- **Type of Cadence:** **Half**

---

### Final Answer:
- **Key of the Melody:** **D major**
- **Root/Quality Chord Symbol of the Second Last Chord:** **D**
- **Root/Quality Chord Symbol of the Last Chord:** **F♯**
- **Functional Chord Symbol for the Second Last Chord:** **I**
- **Functional Chord Symbol for the Last Chord:** **V/V**
- **Type of Cadence:** **Half**
