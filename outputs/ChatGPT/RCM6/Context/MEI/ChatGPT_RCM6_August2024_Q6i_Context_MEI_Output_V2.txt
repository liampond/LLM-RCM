### Step-by-Step Analysis:

#### 1. **Key of the Melody**
- The key signature in the MEI file indicates **3 flats**.
- According to the key signature table:
  - 3 flats correspond to **E♭ major** or **C minor**.
- To determine whether the key is major or minor:
  - The melody contains accidentals such as **B♮** (raised 7th in C minor) and emphasizes **C** as a tonic note.
  - This suggests the key is **C minor**.

**Key:** C minor

#### 2. **Root/Quality Chord Symbol of the Second Last Chord**
- The second last chord is in measure 4, staff 1:
  - Notes: **G (bass), B♮, D**.
- Step-by-step:
  1. **Root:** The bass note is **G**, so the root is **G**.
  2. **Quality:**
     - The third above G is **B♮** (4 half steps → major third).
     - The fifth above G is **D** (7 half steps → perfect fifth).
     - This forms a **G major triad**.
  3. **Chord Symbol:** **G**.

**Root/Quality Chord Symbol (Second Last Chord):** G

#### 3. **Root/Quality Chord Symbol of the Last Chord**
- The last chord is in measure 4, staff 1:
  - Notes: **G (bass), B♮, D** (same as the second last chord).
- Step-by-step:
  1. **Root:** The bass note is **G**, so the root is **G**.
  2. **Quality:**
     - The third above G is **B♮** (4 half steps → major third).
     - The fifth above G is **D** (7 half steps → perfect fifth).
     - This forms a **G major triad**.
  3. **Chord Symbol:** **G**.

**Root/Quality Chord Symbol (Last Chord):** G

#### 4. **Functional Chord Symbol for the Second Last Chord**
- The key is **C minor**.
- The root of the chord is **G**, which is the 5th scale degree in C minor.
- The chord is a **major triad**, so it is the **dominant (V)** chord.

**Functional Chord Symbol (Second Last Chord):** V

#### 5. **Functional Chord Symbol for the Last Chord**
- The last chord is identical to the second last chord:
  - Root: **G**.
  - Quality: **Major triad**.
  - In the key of **C minor**, this is also the **dominant (V)** chord.

**Functional Chord Symbol (Last Chord):** V

#### 6. **Type of Cadence**
- The cadence ends on the **V (dominant)** chord.
- A cadence that ends on the dominant is a **half cadence**.

**Type of Cadence:** Half
