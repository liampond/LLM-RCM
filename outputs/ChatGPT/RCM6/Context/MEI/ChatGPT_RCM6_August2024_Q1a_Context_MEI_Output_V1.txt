### Measure 1:
**Notes:** A4 and G5  
1. **Interval Number:** Count the letter names: A (1), B (2), C (3), D (4), E (5), F (6), G (7). The interval is a seventh.  
2. **Quality:**  
   - The A major scale is: A, B, C♯, D, E, F♯, G♯.  
   - G is one semitone lower than G♯ (the 7th in the A major scale).  
   - Lowering a Major seventh by one semitone makes it a **Minor seventh**.  
**Final Answer:** Minor seventh.
