Let’s analyze the MEI file and determine the requested intervals step by step. The notes in the file are as follows:

1. Measure 1: B♭ (B with a flat accidental) in octave 2  
2. Measure 2: D♯ (D with a sharp accidental) in octave 3  
3. Measure 3: G♭ (G with a flat accidental) in octave 2  
4. Measure 4: C♭ (C with a flat accidental) in octave 3  
5. Measure 5: E (natural) in octave 2  

Now, let’s calculate the requested intervals:

---

### 1. A Perfect 4th above the first note (B♭ in octave 2)
- **Step 2: Interval Number**  
  Count up 4 letter names from B:  
  B (1), C (2), D (3), E (4). The letter name is E.

- **Step 3: Major Scale of the Lower Note**  
  The B♭ major scale is: B♭, C, D, E♭, F, G, A.  
  The 4th note in the scale is E♭, which forms a Perfect 4th.

- **Step 4: Adjust the Quality**  
  A Perfect 4th remains unchanged.

- **Final Answer**: A Perfect 4th above B♭ is **E♭**.

### 2. A Major 3rd above the second note (D♯ in octave 3)
- **Step 2: Interval Number**  
  Count up 3 letter names from D:  
  D (1), E (2), F (3). The letter name is F.

- **Step 3: Major Scale of the Lower Note**  
  The D♯ major scale is: D♯, E♯, F♯, G♯, A♯, B♯, C♯.  
  The 3rd note in the scale is F♯, which forms a Major 3rd.

- **Step 4: Adjust the Quality**  
  A Major 3rd remains unchanged.

- **Final Answer**: A Major 3rd above D♯ is **F♯**.

### 3. A Diminished Octave above the third note (G♭ in octave 2)
- **Step 2: Interval Number**  
  An octave means the same letter name, so the upper note is G.

- **Step 3: Major Scale of the Lower Note**  
  The G♭ major scale is: G♭, A♭, B♭, C♭, D♭, E♭, F.  
  The 8th note in the scale is G♭, which forms a Perfect Octave.

- **Step 4: Adjust the Quality**  
  A Diminished Octave is one semitone lower than a Perfect Octave.  
  Lower G♭ by one semitone → G𝄫 (G double flat).

- **Final Answer**: A Diminished Octave above G♭ is **G𝄫**.

---

### 4. An Augmented 6th above the fourth note (C♭ in octave 3)
- **Step 2: Interval Number**  
  Count up 6 letter names from C:  
  C (1), D (2), E (3), F (4), G (5), A (6). The letter name is A.

- **Step 3: Major Scale of the Lower Note**  
  The C♭ major scale is: C♭, D♭, E♭, F♭, G♭, A♭, B♭.  
  The 6th note in the scale is A♭, which forms a Major 6th.

- **Step 4: Adjust the Quality**  
  An Augmented 6th is one semitone higher than a Major 6th.  
  Raise A♭ by one semitone → A♮.

- **Final Answer**: An Augmented 6th above C♭ is **A♮**.

---

### 5. A Minor 2nd above the final note (E in octave 2)
- **Step 2: Interval Number**  
  Count up 2 letter names from E:  
  E (1), F (2). The letter name is F.

- **Step 3: Major Scale of the Lower Note**  
  The E major scale is: E, F♯, G♯, A, B, C♯, D♯.  
  The 2nd note in the scale is F♯, which forms a Major 2nd.

- **Step 4: Adjust the Quality**  
  A Minor 2nd is one semitone lower than a Major 2nd.  
  Lower F♯ by one semitone → F♮.

- **Final Answer**: A Minor 2nd above E is **F♮**.

---

### Final Results:
1. Perfect 4th above B♭: **E♭**  
2. Major 3rd above D♯: **F♯**  
3. Diminished Octave above G♭: **G𝄫**  
4. Augmented 6th above C♭: **A♮**  
5. Minor 2nd above E: **F♮**
