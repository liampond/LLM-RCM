Thank you for providing the MEI-encoded music file. Let’s analyze the time signatures and beat patterns systematically based on the provided data.

---

### 1. **Understand the Time Signatures**
The MEI file contains multiple time signature changes. Here’s a breakdown:

- **Measure 1–2**: Time signature is **4/2**.
  - **Beats per measure**: 4.
  - **Note value per beat**: Half note.

- **Measure 3–4**: Time signature changes to **6/4**.
  - **Beats per measure**: 6.
  - **Note value per beat**: Quarter note.

- **Measure 5–6**: Time signature changes to **9/8**.
  - **Beats per measure**: 3 (compound time, grouped into three beats of 3 eighth notes each).
  - **Note value per beat**: Dotted quarter note.

- **Measure 7–8**: Time signature changes to **3/4**.
  - **Beats per measure**: 3.
  - **Note value per beat**: Quarter note.

### 2. **Determine the Beat Patterns**
Let’s identify the beat strengths for each time signature:

#### **4/2 (Simple Quadruple Time)**
- Beat 1: Strong.
- Beat 2: Weak.
- Beat 3: Medium.
- Beat 4: Weak.

#### **6/4 (Compound Duple Time)**
- Beat 1: Strong.
- Beat 2: Weak.
- Beat 3: Weak.
- Beat 4: Medium.
- Beat 5: Weak.
- Beat 6: Weak.

#### **9/8 (Compound Triple Time)**
- Beat 1: Strong.
- Beats 2–3: Weak.
- Beat 4: Medium.
- Beats 5–6: Weak.
- Beat 7: Medium.
- Beats 8–9: Weak.

#### **3/4 (Simple Triple Time)**
- Beat 1: Strong.
- Beat 2: Weak.
- Beat 3: Weak.

### 3. **Measure-by-Measure Analysis**
Let’s analyze the notes and rhythms in each measure, ensuring they align with the time signature and beat patterns.

#### **Measure 1 (4/2)**
- Notes: 
  - Dotted whole note (F4) = 3 beats.
  - Whole note (F4, with "x" notehead) = 4 beats.
  - Sixteenth note (F4) = 1/4 beat.
- Total duration: 7 1/4 beats.
- **Correction**: This measure exceeds the 4/2 time signature. Adjustments are needed to fit within 4 beats.

#### **Measure 2 (4/2)**
- Notes:
  - Triplet eighth notes (F4) = 1 beat.
  - Whole note (F4, with "x" notehead) = 4 beats.
- Total duration: 5 beats.
- **Correction**: This measure also exceeds the 4/2 time signature. Adjustments are required.

#### **Measure 3 (6/4)**
- Notes:
  - Sixteenth note (F4) = 1/4 beat.
  - Dotted eighth note (F4) = 3/4 beat.
  - Whole note (F4, with "x" notehead) = 4 beats.
  - Dotted whole note (F4) = 6 beats.
- Total duration: 11 beats.
- **Correction**: This measure exceeds the 6/4 time signature. Adjustments are needed.

#### **Measure 4 (6/4)**
- Notes:
  - Whole note (F4, with "x" notehead) = 4 beats.
  - Eighth note (F4) = 1/2 beat.
  - Two beamed eighth notes (F4) = 1 beat.
  - Whole note (F4) = 4 beats.
- Total duration: 9 1/2 beats.
- **Correction**: This measure exceeds the 6/4 time signature. Adjustments are required.

#### **Measure 5 (9/8)**
- Notes:
  - Sixteenth note (F4) = 1/2 beat.
  - Eighth note (F4) = 1 beat.
  - Sixteenth note (F4) = 1/2 beat.
  - Whole note (F4, with "x" notehead) = 4 beats.
- Total duration: 6 beats.
- **Correction**: This measure is incomplete for 9/8. Add rests to fill the missing beats.

#### **Measure 6 (9/8)**
- Notes:
  - Sixteenth note (F4) = 1/2 beat.
  - Whole note (F4, with "x" notehead) = 4 beats.
  - Eighth note (F4) = 1 beat.
  - Five beamed sixteenth notes (F4) = 2 1/2 beats.
- Total duration: 8 beats.
- **Correction**: This measure is incomplete for 9/8. Add rests to fill the missing beats.

#### **Measure 7 (3/4)**
- Notes:
  - Whole note (F4, with "x" notehead) = 4 beats.
- Total duration: 4 beats.
- **Correction**: This measure exceeds the 3/4 time signature. Adjustments are needed.

#### **Measure 8 (3/4)**
- Notes:
  - Dotted sixteenth note (F4) = 3/8 beat.
  - Whole note (F4, with "x" notehead) = 4 beats.
- Total duration: 4 3/8 beats.
- **Correction**: This measure exceeds the 3/4 time signature. Adjustments are needed.

### 4. **General Observations**
- Many measures exceed their respective time signatures, requiring adjustments to fit the correct number of beats.
- The use of "x" noteheads suggests some notes may be percussive or non-pitched, which could affect interpretation.
- Rests are missing in several measures, particularly in compound time (e.g., 9/8), where blank spaces need to be filled systematically.

### 5. **Next Steps**
To correct the measures:
1. Adjust note durations to fit within the time signature.
2. Add appropriate rests to fill incomplete measures.
3. Verify that each measure adheres to the beat patterns and total duration specified by the time signature.
