To address the question, I will analyze each measure systematically, focusing on the time signature, the provided notes, and the placeholder rhythms (quarter notes with x-shaped noteheads). I will replace the placeholders with appropriate rests to complete the measures while adhering to the rules of beat strength and rest placement.

### Measure 1: Time Signature 4/2
- **Time Signature**: 4/2 (4 beats per measure, half note = 1 beat).
- **Provided Notes**:
  - Dotted whole note (beats 1–3).
  - Placeholder quarter note (beat 4).

**Solution**:
- The dotted whole note occupies beats 1–3.
- Beat 4 is a placeholder. Replace it with a **half rest** to complete the measure.

**Final Measure**:
- Beats 1–3: Dotted whole note.
- Beat 4: Half rest.

### Measure 2: Time Signature 4/2
- **Time Signature**: 4/2 (4 beats per measure, half note = 1 beat).
- **Provided Notes**:
  - Triplet eighth notes (beat 1).
  - Placeholder quarter note (beat 2).
  - Placeholder quarter note (beat 3).
  - Placeholder quarter note (beat 4).

**Solution**:
- The triplet eighth notes fully occupy beat 1.
- Beats 2–4 are placeholders. Replace them with **three half rests** (one for each beat).

**Final Measure**:
- Beat 1: Triplet eighth notes.
- Beats 2–4: Three half rests.

### Measure 3: Time Signature 6/4
- **Time Signature**: 6/4 (6 beats per measure, quarter note = 1 beat).
- **Provided Notes**:
  - Placeholder quarter note (beat 1).
  - Placeholder quarter note (beat 2).
  - Placeholder quarter note (beat 3).
  - Placeholder quarter note (beat 4).
  - Placeholder quarter note (beat 5).
  - Placeholder quarter note (beat 6).

**Solution**:
- All beats are placeholders. Replace them with **a dotted whole rest** to cover all 6 beats.

**Final Measure**:
- Beats 1–6: Dotted whole rest.

---

### Measure 4: Time Signature 6/4
- **Time Signature**: 6/4 (6 beats per measure, quarter note = 1 beat).
- **Provided Notes**:
  - Placeholder quarter note (beat 1).
  - Placeholder quarter note (beat 2).
  - Placeholder quarter note (beat 3).
  - Placeholder quarter note (beat 4).
  - Placeholder quarter note (beat 5).
  - Placeholder quarter note (beat 6).

**Solution**:
- All beats are placeholders. Replace them with **a dotted whole rest** to cover all 6 beats.

**Final Measure**:
- Beats 1–6: Dotted whole rest.

---

### Measure 5: Time Signature 9/8
- **Time Signature**: 9/8 (9 beats per measure, eighth note = 1 beat, grouped into 3 sets of 3 beats).
- **Provided Notes**:
  - Placeholder quarter note (beats 1–3).
  - Placeholder quarter note (beats 4–6).
  - Placeholder quarter note (beats 7–9).

**Solution**:
- Each placeholder quarter note spans 2 eighth notes. Replace each with **a dotted quarter rest** to cover each group of 3 beats.

**Final Measure**:
- Beats 1–3: Dotted quarter rest.
- Beats 4–6: Dotted quarter rest.
- Beats 7–9: Dotted quarter rest.

---

### Measure 6: Time Signature 9/8
- **Time Signature**: 9/8 (9 beats per measure, eighth note = 1 beat, grouped into 3 sets of 3 beats).
- **Provided Notes**:
  - Placeholder quarter note (beats 1–3).
  - Placeholder quarter note (beats 4–6).
  - Placeholder quarter note (beats 7–9).

**Solution**:
- Each placeholder quarter note spans 2 eighth notes. Replace each with **a dotted quarter rest** to cover each group of 3 beats.

**Final Measure**:
- Beats 1–3: Dotted quarter rest.
- Beats 4–6: Dotted quarter rest.
- Beats 7–9: Dotted quarter rest.

---

### Measure 7: Time Signature 3/4
- **Time Signature**: 3/4 (3 beats per measure, quarter note = 1 beat).
- **Provided Notes**:
  - Placeholder quarter note (beat 1).
  - Placeholder quarter note (beat 2).
  - Placeholder quarter note (beat 3).

**Solution**:
- All beats are placeholders. Replace them with **a whole rest** (used in 3/4 to cover all 3 beats).

**Final Measure**:
- Beats 1–3: Whole rest.

---

### Measure 8: Time Signature 3/4
- **Time Signature**: 3/4 (3 beats per measure, quarter note = 1 beat).
- **Provided Notes**:
  - Placeholder quarter note (beat 1).
  - Placeholder quarter note (beat 2).
  - Placeholder quarter note (beat 3).

**Solution**:
- All beats are placeholders. Replace them with **a whole rest** (used in 3/4 to cover all 3 beats).

**Final Measure**:
- Beats 1–3: Whole rest.

1. **4/2**: Half rest for beat 4.
2. **4/2**: Three half rests for beats 2–4.
3. **6/4**: Dotted whole rest for beats 1–6.
4. **6/4**: Dotted whole rest for beats 1–6.
5. **9/8**: Three dotted quarter rests for beats 1–3, 4–6, and 7–9.
6. **9/8**: Three dotted quarter rests for beats 1–3, 4–6, and 7–9.
7. **3/4**: Whole rest for beats 1–3.
8. **3/4**: Whole rest for beats 1–3.
