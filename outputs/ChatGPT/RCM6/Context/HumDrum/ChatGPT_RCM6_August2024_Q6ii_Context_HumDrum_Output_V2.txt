Let’s analyze the provided HumDrum file step by step using the guides.

### 1. **Key of the Melody**
- The key signature is `k[f#c#]`, which indicates **D major** or **B minor**.
- To determine whether it is major or minor, we look for accidentals or harmonic/melodic clues.
  - The melody contains a **C#** (raised 7th in B minor) and no other accidentals that suggest a minor mode.
  - The harmonic content and the final chord (D major) strongly suggest **D major** as the key.

**Key: D major**

### 2. **Root/Quality Chord Symbol of the Second Last Chord**
- The second last chord is: `4AA` in the bass and `4e 4a 4cc#` in the treble.
  - Notes: A, C#, E (and A doubled).
  - Root: A (lowest note in the bass).
  - Quality:
    - A → C# = major third (4 half steps).
    - A → E = perfect fifth (7 half steps).
    - This is a major triad.

**Root/Quality Chord Symbol: A (A major)**

### 3. **Root/Quality Chord Symbol of the Last Chord**
- The last chord is: `2.F#` in the bass and `2.f#) 2.a 2.dd` in the treble.
  - Notes: D, F#, A (and F# doubled).
  - Root: D (lowest note in the bass).
  - Quality:
    - D → F# = major third (4 half steps).
    - D → A = perfect fifth (7 half steps).
    - This is a major triad.

**Root/Quality Chord Symbol: D (D major)**

- A cadence that resolves from V to I is an **authentic cadence**.

**Type of Cadence: Authentic**
