### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Melody in the HumDrum File:

#### 1. **Key of the Melody**
- The key signature is `k[b-e-a-]`, which indicates three flats.
- Using the key signature chart, three flats correspond to **E♭ major** or **C minor**.
- To determine whether the key is major or minor, we look for accidentals or harmonic/melodic clues.
  - The melody contains a **B♮** (e.g., in the second last chord), which is the raised seventh degree in **C minor**.
  - This suggests the piece is in **C minor**.
  
**Key: C minor**
