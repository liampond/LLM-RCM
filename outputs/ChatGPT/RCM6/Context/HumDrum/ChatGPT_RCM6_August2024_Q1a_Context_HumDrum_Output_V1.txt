Let’s analyze the intervals between the notes in each measure of the provided HumDrum file step by step. I will follow the process outlined in your guide.

### Measure 1: Notes are **a** and **gg**
1. **Identify the Notes**: The notes are A (lower note) and G (higher note, two octaves below A).
2. **Determine the Interval Number**: Count the letter names:
   - A (1), G (2), F (3), E (4), D (5), C (6), B (7), A (8), G (9).
   - The interval is a **ninth**.
3. **Determine the Quality**:
   - The A major scale is: A, B, C♯, D, E, F♯, G♯.
   - G (natural) is one semitone lower than G♯, which would be the 7th in the A major scale.
   - A to G (natural) is a **minor seventh**.
   - Since the G is an octave lower, the interval is a **compound minor seventh**, or a **minor ninth**.
4. **Final Answer**: **Minor ninth**.

### Measure 2: Notes are **f#** and **b-X** (B double flat)
1. **Identify the Notes**: The notes are F♯ (lower note) and B𝄫 (higher note).
2. **Determine the Interval Number**: Count the letter names:
   - F (1), G (2), A (3), B (4).
   - The interval is a **fourth**.
3. **Determine the Quality**:
   - The F♯ major scale is: F♯, G♯, A♯, B, C♯, D♯, E♯.
   - B is the 4th note in the F♯ major scale.
   - B𝄫 is two semitones lower than B.
   - Lowering a Perfect fourth by two semitones makes it a **doubly diminished fourth**.
4. **Final Answer**: **Doubly diminished fourth**.

### Measure 3: Notes are **e** and **cc#** (C double sharp)
1. **Identify the Notes**: The notes are E (lower note) and C𝄪 (higher note).
2. **Determine the Interval Number**: Count the letter names:
   - E (1), F (2), G (3), A (4), B (5), C (6).
   - The interval is a **sixth**.
3. **Determine the Quality**:
   - The E major scale is: E, F♯, G♯, A, B, C♯, D♯.
   - C♯ is the 6th note in the E major scale.
   - C𝄪 is one semitone higher than C♯.
   - Raising a Major sixth by one semitone makes it an **augmented sixth**.
4. **Final Answer**: **Augmented sixth**.

### Measure 4: Notes are **cc-X** (C double flat) and **dd** (D natural)
1. **Identify the Notes**: The notes are C𝄫 (lower note) and D (higher note).
2. **Determine the Interval Number**: Count the letter names:
   - C (1), D (2).
   - The interval is a **second**.
3. **Determine the Quality**:
   - The C♭ major scale is: C♭, D♭, E♭, F♭, G♭, A♭, B♭.
   - D♭ is the 2nd note in the C♭ major scale.
   - D (natural) is one semitone higher than D♭.
   - Raising a Minor second by one semitone makes it a **Major second**.
4. **Final Answer**: **Major second**.

### Measure 5: Notes are **b** and **ff#** (F double sharp)
1. **Identify the Notes**: The notes are B (lower note) and F𝄪 (higher note).
2. **Determine the Interval Number**: Count the letter names:
   - B (1), C (2), D (3), E (4), F (5).
   - The interval is a **fifth**.
3. **Determine the Quality**:
   - The B major scale is: B, C♯, D♯, E, F♯, G♯, A♯.
   - F♯ is the 5th note in the B major scale.
   - F𝄪 is one semitone higher than F♯.
   - Raising a Perfect fifth by one semitone makes it an **augmented fifth**.
4. **Final Answer**: **Augmented fifth**.
