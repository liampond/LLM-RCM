Let’s analyze the provided HumDrum file step by step using the guides.

### 1. **Key of the Melody**
- The key signature is `k[b-e-a-]`, which indicates **three flats**.
- From the key signature, the possible keys are **E♭ major** or **C minor**.
- To determine whether it is major or minor, we look for accidentals or harmonic/melodic content.
  - The melody contains **B♮** (e.g., in the second last chord), which is the raised 7th scale degree in **C minor**.
  - This suggests the piece is in **C minor**.

**Key:** C minor

### 2. **Root/Quality Chord Symbol of the Second Last Chord**
- The second last chord is encoded as `4C 4g 4cc 4ee-` in the bass and treble staves.
  - Notes: **C, E♭, G** (C is doubled).
  - Root: **C** (lowest note).
  - Third: **E♭** (3 half steps above C → minor third).
  - Fifth: **G** (7 half steps above C → perfect fifth).
  - This is a **C minor triad**.

**Root/Quality Chord Symbol (Second Last Chord): Cm**

### 3. **Root/Quality Chord Symbol of the Last Chord**
- The last chord is encoded as `2.GG 2.g) 2.bn 2.dd` in the bass and treble staves.
  - Notes: **G, B♮, D** (G is doubled).
  - Root: **G** (lowest note).
  - Third: **B♮** (4 half steps above G → major third).
  - Fifth: **D** (7 half steps above G → perfect fifth).
  - This is a **G major triad**.

**Root/Quality Chord Symbol (Last Chord): G**

### 4. **Functional Chord Symbol for the Second Last Chord**
- In the key of **C minor**, the chord **Cm** (C, E♭, G) is built on the **1st scale degree**.
- This makes it the **tonic triad**.

**Functional Chord Symbol (Second Last Chord): i**

---

### 5. **Functional Chord Symbol for the Last Chord**
- In the key of **C minor**, the chord **G** (G, B♮, D) is built on the **5th scale degree**.
- This makes it the **dominant triad**.

**Functional Chord Symbol (Last Chord): V**

---

### 6. **Type of Cadence**
- The cadence moves from **i (C minor)** to **V (G major)**.
- A cadence that ends on the dominant (V) is a **half cadence**.

**Type of Cadence:** Half

### Final Answer:
- **Key of the Melody:** C minor
- **Root/Quality Chord Symbol (Second Last Chord):** Cm
- **Root/Quality Chord Symbol (Last Chord):** G
- **Functional Chord Symbol (Second Last Chord):** i
- **Functional Chord Symbol (Last Chord):** V
- **Type of Cadence:** Half
