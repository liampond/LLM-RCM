To transpose the melody from the original key of E major to A♭ major, we first determine the interval of transposition.

### Step 1: Determine the Interval of Transposition
- The original key is **E major**.
- The target key is **A♭ major**.
- Count the letter names from E to A: E (1), F (2), G (3), A (4). This is a **fourth**.
- E to A♭ involves a semitone adjustment. A♭ is one semitone lower than A natural, so the interval is a **diminished fourth**.

Thus, the interval of transposition is a **diminished fourth upward**.

### Step 2: Transpose the Key Signature
The original key signature is **E major** (4 sharps: F♯, C♯, G♯, D♯).  
The new key signature is **A♭ major** (4 flats: B♭, E♭, A♭, D♭).

### Step 3: Transpose Each Note
We now transpose each note in the melody up by a diminished fourth. Below is the transposed melody with the correct notes and rhythms.

### Step 4: Explanation of Transposition
Here is how each note was transposed up by a diminished fourth:

1. **E → A♭**  
   E to A is a perfect fourth. Lowering A to A♭ makes it a diminished fourth.

2. **G♯ → C**  
   G♯ to C is a perfect fourth. No adjustment is needed.

3. **B → E♭**  
   B to E is a perfect fourth. Lowering E to E♭ makes it a diminished fourth.

4. **D♯ → F**  
   D♯ to G is a perfect fourth. Lowering G to F makes it a diminished fourth.

5. **F♯ → A♭**  
   F♯ to B is a perfect fourth. Lowering B to A♭ makes it a diminished fourth.

6. **C♯ → D**  
   C♯ to F is a perfect fourth. Lowering F to D makes it a diminished fourth.

### Final Answer:
- The interval of transposition is a **diminished fourth upward**.
- The transposed melody is provided above in A♭ major with the correct key signature, notes, and rhythms.
