### 1. **The mediant triad of E-flat major in root position**
- **Step 1: Identify the root note**
  - Key: E-flat major.
  - Scale: E♭, F, G, A♭, B♭, C, D, E♭.
  - The mediant is the 3rd scale degree: G.

- **Step 2: Write the notes of the chord**
  - Root = G.
  - Third = 3rd note from G in the E-flat major scale: G, A♭, B♭ → Third = B♭.
  - Fifth = 5th note from G in the E-flat major scale: G, A♭, B♭, C, D → Fifth = D.
  - Chord: G, B♭, D.

- **Step 3: Determine the inversion**
  - Root position: Root, third, fifth.
  - Order: G, B♭, D.

- **Step 4: Final Answer**
  - **Notes: G, B♭, D.**
  - **Key signature: B♭, E♭, A♭.**

### 2. **The submediant triad of A-sharp minor, harmonic form, in second inversion**
- **Step 1: Identify the root note**
  - Key: A-sharp minor (harmonic minor).
  - Scale: A♯, B♯, C♯, D♯, E♯, F♯, G𝄪, A♯.
  - The submediant is the 6th scale degree: F♯.

- **Step 2: Write the notes of the chord**
  - Root = F♯.
  - Third = 3rd note from F♯ in the A-sharp harmonic minor scale: F♯, G𝄪, A♯ → Third = A♯.
  - Fifth = 5th note from F♯ in the A-sharp harmonic minor scale: F♯, G𝄪, A♯, B♯, C♯ → Fifth = C♯.
  - Chord: F♯, A♯, C♯.

- **Step 3: Determine the inversion**
  - Second inversion: Fifth becomes the lowest note.
  - Order: C♯ (5th), F♯ (root), A♯ (3rd).

- **Step 4: Final Answer**
  - **Notes: C♯, F♯, A♯.**
  - **Key signature: F♯, C♯, G♯, D♯, A♯, E♯.**
  - **Accidental: G𝄪 (raised 7th in harmonic minor).**

  - Scale: C♯, D♯, E, F♯, G♯, A, B♯, C♯.
  - The dominant is the 5th scale degree: G♯.

- **Step 2: Write the notes of the chord**
  - Root = G♯.
  - Third = 3rd note from G♯ in the C-sharp harmonic minor scale: G♯, A, B♯ → Third = B♯.
  - Fifth = 5th note from G♯ in the C-sharp harmonic minor scale: G♯, A, B♯, C♯, D♯ → Fifth = D♯.
  - Chord: G♯, B♯, D♯.

- **Step 3: Determine the inversion**
