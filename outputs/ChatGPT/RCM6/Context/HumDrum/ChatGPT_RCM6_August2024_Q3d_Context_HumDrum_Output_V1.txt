The A major scale consists of the notes A, B, C#, D, E, F#, and G#. Using the key signature of A major (three sharps: F#, C#, and G#), the notes in ascending and descending order in the treble clef are:

**Ascending:** A, B, C#, D, E, F#, G#, A  
**Descending:** A, G#, F#, E, D, C#, B, A  

No additional accidentals are needed, as the key signature accounts for the sharps.
