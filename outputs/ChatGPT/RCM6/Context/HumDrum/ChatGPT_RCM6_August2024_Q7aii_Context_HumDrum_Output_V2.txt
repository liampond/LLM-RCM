### Step 1: Determine the Key

#### 1. Check the Key Signature
The key signature in the file is `*k[b-e-a-d-g-]`, which indicates **five flats**. Referring to the table provided:
- Five flats correspond to **D♭ Major** or **B♭ Minor**.

#### 2. Determine if the Key is Major or Minor
To decide between D♭ Major and B♭ Minor, we look for the presence of accidentals that indicate a raised seventh degree (leading tone) in the minor key. In B♭ Minor, the raised seventh degree would be **A♮** (instead of A♭).

- In the encoded music, there is no A♮ present. Instead, the notes emphasize **D♭**, **B♭**, and other pitches consistent with the major key.
- The absence of a raised seventh degree and the harmonic emphasis on D♭ suggest the key is **D♭ Major**.

#### Key: **D♭ Major**

### Step 2: Determine the Time Signature

#### 1. Identify the Beat Groupings
We analyze the rhythmic values and groupings in the file:

- Measure 1:
  - `8a-` = 1/8 note.
  - Total = 1/8.

- Measure 2:
  - `8dd-L` + `8dd-J` + `8ffL` + `8ffJ` = 1/8 + 1/8 + 1/8 + 1/8 = 4/8.
  - Total = 4/8.

- Measure 3:
  - `4dd-` = 2/4 = 4/8.
  - `8a-L` + `8a-J` = 1/8 + 1/8 = 2/8.
  - Total = 4/8 + 2/8 = 6/8.

- Measure 4:
  - `8.a-L` = 3/16.
  - `16a-Jk` = 1/16.
  - `16ee-LL` + `16dd-` + `16cc` + `16b-JJ` = 1/16 + 1/16 + 1/16 + 1/16 = 4/16.
  - Total = 3/16 + 1/16 + 4/16 = 8/16 = 4/8.

- Measure 5:
  - `4a-` = 2/4 = 4/8.
  - Total = 4/8.

#### 2. Check the Total Value of the Beam Groupings
The rhythmic groupings suggest **compound time** because the measures consistently add up to multiples of 3 smaller beats (e.g., 6/8, 4/8 with subdivisions into 3/16 or 3/8).

#### 3. Count the Total Beats in the Measure
The measures consistently group into **6 smaller beats per measure**, with each smaller beat being an **eighth note** (1/8).

#### 4. Write the Time Signature
- The top number is **6** (total smaller beats per measure).
- The bottom number is **8** (eighth note as the beat unit).

#### Time Signature: **6/8**

### Summary

- **Key**: D♭ Major
- **Time Signature**: 6/8

The piece is in D♭ Major, with a compound meter of 6/8, indicating two beats per measure, each subdivided into three eighth notes.
