### Step 1: Determine the Key

#### 1. Check the Key Signature
The key signature in the file is `*k[f#]`, which indicates one sharp (F♯). According to the key signature table:
- 1 sharp corresponds to **G Major** or **E Minor**.

#### 2. Determine if the Key is Major or Minor
To distinguish between G Major and E Minor, we look for the presence of a raised seventh degree (D♯) in the melody, which would indicate E Minor. In the file, we see a `16d#X` in measure 1, which is a D♯. This is the raised seventh degree of E Minor, confirming that the piece is in **E Minor**.

#### Final Key: **E Minor**

### Step 2: Determine the Time Signature

#### Step 1: Identify the Beat Groupings
We analyze the rhythmic groupings in the file. Here are the rhythmic values for each measure:

**Measure 1:**
- `16r` = 1/16
- `16gLL` = 1/16
- `16a` = 1/16
- `16b` = 1/16
- `16cc` = 1/16
- `16aJJ` = 1/16
Total = 6/16

**Measure 2:**
- `16bLL` = 1/16
- `16g` = 1/16
- `16f#` = 1/16
- `16e` = 1/16
- `16d#X` = 1/16
- `16aJJ` = 1/16
Total = 6/16

**Measure 3:**
- `32gLLL` = 1/32
- `32f#J` = 1/32
- `16eJ` = 1/16
- `8eeJ` = 2/16
- `8r` = 2/16
Total = 6/16

**Measure 4:**
- `32dd#XLLL` = 1/32
- `32cc#XJ` = 1/32
- `16bJ` = 1/16
- `8aaJ` = 2/16
- `8r` = 2/16
Total = 6/16

#### Step 2: Check the Total Value of the Beam Groupings
Each measure adds up to 6/16, and the rhythmic groupings suggest compound time (groupings of three smaller beats). This indicates that the time signature is in compound meter.

#### Step 3: Determine the Bottom Number
The smallest rhythmic value is a sixteenth note, so the bottom number of the time signature is **16**.

#### Step 4: Count the Total Beats in the Measure
Each measure contains 6 sixteenth notes grouped into two beats of three sixteenth notes each. This indicates a compound duple meter.

#### Final Time Signature: **6/16**

### Final Answer:
- **Key:** E Minor
- **Time Signature:** 6/16
