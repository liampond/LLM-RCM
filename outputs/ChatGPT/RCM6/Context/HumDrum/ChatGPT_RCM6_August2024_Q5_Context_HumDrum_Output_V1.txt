  - Fifth = 5th note from G in the scale: G, A♭, B♭, C, D → Fifth = D.
  - Chord: G, B♭, D.

- **Step 3: Determine the inversion**
  - Root position: Root, third, fifth.
  - Order: G, B♭, D.

- **Final Answer**: **G, B♭, D**.

- **Key signature**: B♭, E♭, A♭.

### 2. **The submediant triad of A-sharp minor, harmonic form, in second inversion**
- **Step 1: Identify the root note**
  - Key: A-sharp minor (harmonic).
  - Scale: A♯, B♯, C♯, D♯, E♯, F♯, G𝄪, A♯.
  - The submediant is the 6th scale degree: F♯.

- **Step 2: Write the notes of the chord**
  - Root = F♯.
  - Third = 3rd note from F♯ in the scale: F♯, G𝄪, A♯ → Third = A♯.
  - Fifth = 5th note from F♯ in the scale: F♯, G𝄪, A♯, B♯, C♯ → Fifth = C♯.
