To determine the time signature of the encoded music in the provided HumDrum file, we will analyze the rhythmic groupings and total note values in each measure. Letâ€™s proceed step by step.

---

### Measure 1 (`=1` to `=`):
#### Notes and Rhythms:
- `4.f` = dotted quarter note = 1.5 beats
- `8f` = eighth note = 0.5 beats
- `16fLL` = sixteenth note = 0.25 beats
- `16fJ` = sixteenth note = 0.25 beats
- `8fJ` = eighth note = 0.5 beats
- `8fL` = eighth note = 0.5 beats
- `8fJ` = eighth note = 0.5 beats

#### Total Rhythmic Value:
1.5 + 0.5 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 = **4 beats**

#### Grouping Analysis:
- The notes are grouped into clear subdivisions of 2 or 4 smaller beats, suggesting **simple time**.
- The beat unit is a **quarter note** (1 beat = 1 quarter note).

#### Time Signature:
The measure contains **4 beats**, each represented by a quarter note. Therefore, the time signature is **4/4**.

### Measure 2 (`=` to `==`):
#### Notes and Rhythms:
- `16fLL` = sixteenth note = 0.25 beats
- `16f` = sixteenth note = 0.25 beats
- `32fL` = thirty-second note = 0.125 beats
- `32fJJJ` = thirty-second note = 0.125 beats
- `16.fLL` = dotted sixteenth note = 0.375 beats
- `32fK` = thirty-second note = 0.125 beats
- `16fJJ` = sixteenth note = 0.25 beats
- `8fL` = eighth note = 0.5 beats
- `16fJk` = sixteenth note = 0.25 beats

#### Total Rhythmic Value:
0.25 + 0.25 + 0.125 + 0.125 + 0.375 + 0.125 + 0.25 + 0.5 + 0.25 = **2 beats**

#### Grouping Analysis:
- The notes are grouped into smaller subdivisions, but the total rhythmic value of the measure is **2 beats**.
- The beat unit is a **quarter note** (1 beat = 1 quarter note), suggesting **simple time**.

#### Time Signature:
The measure contains **2 beats**, each represented by a quarter note. Therefore, the time signature is **2/4**.

### Final Answer:
- Measure 1: **4/4**
- Measure 2: **2/4**
