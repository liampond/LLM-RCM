Let’s analyze the intervals between the notes in each measure of the provided HumDrum file step by step. I will follow the process outlined in your guide.

---

### Measure 1: Notes are **a** and **gg**
- **Step 1: Identify the Notes**  
  The notes are A (lower note) and G (higher note).

- **Step 2: Determine the Interval Number**  
  Count the letter names: A (1), B (2), C (3), D (4), E (5), F (6), G (7).  
  The interval is a seventh.

- **Step 3: Determine the Quality of the Interval**  
  The A major scale is: A, B, C♯, D, E, F♯, G♯.  
  In this scale, G♯ is the 7th note. G (natural) is one semitone lower than G♯.  
  Lowering a Major seventh by one semitone makes it a **Minor seventh**.

- **Final Answer for Measure 1**: **Minor seventh**.

### Measure 2: Notes are **f#** and **b-X** (B double flat)
- **Step 1: Identify the Notes**  
  The notes are F♯ (lower note) and B♭♭ (higher note).

- **Step 2: Determine the Interval Number**  
  Count the letter names: F (1), G (2), A (3), B (4).  
  The interval is a fourth.

- **Step 3: Determine the Quality of the Interval**  
  The F♯ major scale is: F♯, G♯, A♯, B, C♯, D♯, E♯.  
  In this scale, B is the 4th note. B♭♭ is two semitones lower than B.  
  Lowering a Perfect fourth by two semitones makes it a **Diminished fourth**.

- **Final Answer for Measure 2**: **Diminished fourth**.

### Measure 3: Notes are **e** and **cc#** (C double sharp)
- **Step 1: Identify the Notes**  
  The notes are E (lower note) and C𝄪 (higher note).

- **Step 2: Determine the Interval Number**  
  Count the letter names: E (1), F (2), G (3), A (4), B (5), C (6).  
  The interval is a sixth.

- **Step 3: Determine the Quality of the Interval**  
  The E major scale is: E, F♯, G♯, A, B, C♯, D♯.  
  In this scale, C♯ is the 6th note. C𝄪 is one semitone higher than C♯.  
  Raising a Major sixth by one semitone makes it an **Augmented sixth**.

- **Final Answer for Measure 3**: **Augmented sixth**.

### Measure 4: Notes are **cc-X** (C double flat) and **dd** (D natural)
- **Step 1: Identify the Notes**  
  The notes are C♭♭ (lower note) and D (higher note).

- **Step 2: Determine the Interval Number**  
  Count the letter names: C (1), D (2).  
  The interval is a second.

- **Step 3: Determine the Quality of the Interval**  
  The C♭♭ major scale is: C♭♭, D♭♭, E♭♭, F♭♭, G♭♭, A♭♭, B♭♭.  
  In this scale, D♭♭ is the 2nd note. D (natural) is three semitones higher than D♭♭.  
  Raising a Diminished second by three semitones makes it a **Triple augmented second**.

- **Final Answer for Measure 4**: **Triple augmented second**.

---

### Measure 5: Notes are **b** and **ff#** (F double sharp)
- **Step 1: Identify the Notes**  
  The notes are B (lower note) and F𝄪 (higher note).

- **Step 2: Determine the Interval Number**  
  Count the letter names: B (1), C (2), D (3), E (4), F (5).  
  The interval is a fifth.

- **Step 3: Determine the Quality of the Interval**  
  The B major scale is: B, C♯, D♯, E, F♯, G♯, A♯.  
  In this scale, F♯ is the 5th note. F𝄪 is one semitone higher than F♯.  
  Raising a Perfect fifth by one semitone makes it an **Augmented fifth**.

- **Final Answer for Measure 5**: **Augmented fifth**.
