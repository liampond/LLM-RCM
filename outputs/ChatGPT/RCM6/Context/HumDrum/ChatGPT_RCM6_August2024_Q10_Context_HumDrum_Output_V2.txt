### Answers:

1. **Key of the Piece**  
   The key signature indicates **B♭ minor** (5 flats: B♭, E♭, A♭, D♭, G♭). There are no accidentals suggesting a raised 7th (A♮), so the piece is in **B♭ minor** rather than its relative major (D♭ major).

2. **Time Signature**  
   The rhythmic groupings suggest **6/8** time. The eighth notes are grouped in sets of three, indicating compound duple meter.

3. **Chord Outlined by the First Three Eighth Notes of Bar 2 (Both Hands)**  
   - Left hand: F, A♭, C.  
   - Right hand: F, A♭, C.  
   These notes form an **F minor triad**, which is the **subdominant triad** (iv) in B♭ minor.

4. **Interval Between the Last Eighth Note in the Left Hand of Bar 2 and the First Note in the Left Hand of Bar 3**  
   - Last note of bar 2: **F**.  
   - First note of bar 3: **E♭**.  
   From F to E♭ is a **minor seventh**.

5. **Functional Chord Symbol for the First Three Eighth Notes of Bar 5 (Both Hands)**  
   - Left hand: G, B♭, D♭.  
   - Right hand: G, B♭, D♭.  
   These notes form a **G diminished triad**. In B♭ minor, this is the **supertonic diminished triad (ii°)**.

6. **Chord Outlined by the Last Three Eighth Notes of Bar 7 (Both Hands)**  
   - Left hand: B♭, D♭, F.  
   - Right hand: B♭, D♭, F.  
   These notes form a **B♭ minor triad**, which is the **tonic triad (i)** in B♭ minor.

7. **Interval Between the Second Eighth Note in the Left Hand of Bar 8 and the Third Eighth Note in the Left Hand of Bar 8**  
   - Second note: **A♭**.  
   - Third note: **B♭**.  
   From A♭ to B♭ is a **major second**.

8. **Rest to Complete Bar 8 in the Right Hand**  
   After the F in the right hand, there is a missing eighth note to complete the bar. The rest should be an **eighth rest**.

9. **Parallel or Contrasting Period**  
   The two phrases begin with similar melodic material, making this a **parallel period**. The antecedent ends with a weaker cadence, and the consequent ends with a stronger cadence.

10. **Meaning of Allegretto Vivace**  
    - **Allegretto**: A moderately fast tempo, slightly slower than Allegro.  
    - **Vivace**: Lively and spirited.  
    Together, "Allegretto vivace" suggests a moderately fast tempo with a lively and energetic character.

### Summary:
The piece is in **B♭ minor** and written in **6/8 time**. The harmonic analysis reveals the use of subdominant, supertonic diminished, and tonic triads, with intervals such as a **minor seventh** and a **major second**. The passage is a **parallel period**, and the tempo marking "Allegretto vivace" indicates a moderately fast and lively character.
