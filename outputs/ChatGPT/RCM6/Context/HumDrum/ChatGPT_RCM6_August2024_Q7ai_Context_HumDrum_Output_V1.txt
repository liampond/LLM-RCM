### Step 1: Determine the Key
#### 1. Check the Key Signature
The key signature in the file is `*k[f#]`, which indicates one sharp (F♯). According to the key signature table:
- 1 sharp corresponds to **G Major** or **E Minor**.

#### 2. Determine if the Key is Major or Minor
To decide between G Major and E Minor, we look for the raised seventh degree (D♯) that would indicate E Minor. However, there are no accidentals in the file that suggest a raised D♯. Additionally, the melodic and harmonic content emphasizes G and D, which are characteristic of G Major.

#### 3. Look for Other Clues
The piece begins and ends with notes that emphasize G (e.g., `16ggLL` and `8gg`), further supporting G Major as the key.

**Key: G Major**

### Step 2: Determine the Time Signature
#### 1. Identify the Beat Groupings
The rhythmic values in the file are as follows:
- Measure 1: `16dd`
- Measure 2: `16ggLL 16bb 16ff#JJ 16ggLL 16bb 16ddJJ`
- Measure 3: `16ggLL 16bb 16ff#JJ 16ggLL 16bb 16ddJJ`
- Measure 4: `16eeLL 16cc 16gJJ 8ggL 16ccJk 16ddLL 16b 16gJJ 8gg`

Let’s analyze the rhythmic groupings in each measure.

#### Measure 1
- `16dd` = 1 sixteenth note = 0.25 beats.

#### Measure 2
- `16ggLL 16bb 16ff#JJ 16ggLL 16bb 16ddJJ`:
  - Each sixteenth note = 0.25 beats.
  - Total = 6 × 0.25 = 1.5 beats.

#### Measure 3
- `16ggLL 16bb 16ff#JJ 16ggLL 16bb 16ddJJ`:
  - Same as Measure 2.
  - Total = 1.5 beats.

#### Measure 4
- `16eeLL 16cc 16gJJ 8ggL 16ccJk 16ddLL 16b 16gJJ 8gg`:
  - `16eeLL` = 0.25 beats.
  - `16cc` = 0.25 beats.
  - `16gJJ` = 0.25 beats.
  - `8ggL` = 0.5 beats.
  - `16ccJk` = 0.25 beats.
  - `16ddLL` = 0.25 beats.
  - `16b` = 0.25 beats.
  - `16gJJ` = 0.25 beats.
  - `8gg` = 0.5 beats.
  - Total = 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.5 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.5 = 2.75 beats.

#### 2. Check the Total Value of the Beam Groupings
The rhythmic groupings are inconsistent across measures, but the most common grouping (Measures 2 and 3) totals **1.5 beats per measure**.

#### 3. Determine the Bottom Number
The smallest rhythmic value is a sixteenth note (0.25 beats). Since the beat groupings are based on sixteenth notes, the bottom number of the time signature is **16**.

#### 4. Count the Total Beats in the Measure
The most consistent measure length is 1.5 beats, which corresponds to **3 sixteenth notes per measure**.

#### 5. Write the Time Signature
The time signature is **3/16**, indicating a compound meter with one beat per measure, divided into three sixteenth notes.

### Final Answer
- **Key:** G Major
- **Time Signature:** 3/16
