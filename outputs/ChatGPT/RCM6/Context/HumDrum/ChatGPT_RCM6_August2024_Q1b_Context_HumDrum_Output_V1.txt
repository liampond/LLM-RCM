Let’s analyze the encoded HumDrum file step by step and determine the requested intervals.

### File Analysis:
1. **First note**: `BB-X` (B double flat)
2. **Second note**: `D#X` (D double sharp)
3. **Third note**: `GG-X` (G double flat)
4. **Fourth note**: `C-X` (C double flat)
5. **Fifth note**: `EE` (E natural)

### Requested Intervals:
#### 1. A Perfect 4th above the first note (`BB-X`):
- **Step 1**: Interval number is a 4th. Count letter names: B (1), C (2), D (3), E (4). The letter name is E.
- **Step 2**: The B♭♭ major scale is: B♭♭, C♭, D♭, E♭♭, F♭, G♭, A♭. The 4th note is E♭♭.
- **Step 3**: A Perfect 4th remains unchanged in quality.
- **Answer**: The note is `Ebb` (E double flat).

#### 2. A Major 3rd above the second note (`D#X`):
- **Step 1**: Interval number is a 3rd. Count letter names: D (1), E (2), F (3). The letter name is F.
- **Step 2**: The D♯ major scale is: D♯, E♯, F♯, G♯, A♯, B♯, C♯♯. The 3rd note is F♯.
- **Step 3**: A Major 3rd above D♯ is F♯.
- **Step 4**: Adjust for the double sharp: F♯ raised by one semitone → F𝄪.
- **Answer**: The note is `F𝄪` (F double sharp).

#### 3. A Diminished Octave above the third note (`GG-X`):
- **Step 1**: Interval number is an octave. Count letter names: G (1), G (8). The letter name is G.
- **Step 2**: The G♭♭ major scale is: G♭♭, A♭♭, B♭♭, C♭♭, D♭♭, E♭♭, F♭♭, G♭♭. The 8th note is G♭♭.
- **Step 3**: A diminished octave is one semitone lower than a Perfect octave.
- **Step 4**: Lower G♭♭ by one semitone → G♭♭♭.
- **Answer**: The note is `Gbbb` (G triple flat).

#### 4. An Augmented 6th above the fourth note (`C-X`):
- **Step 1**: Interval number is a 6th. Count letter names: C (1), D (2), E (3), F (4), G (5), A (6). The letter name is A.
- **Step 2**: The C♭♭ major scale is: C♭♭, D♭♭, E♭♭, F♭♭, G♭♭, A♭♭, B♭♭. The 6th note is A♭♭.
- **Step 3**: An augmented 6th is one semitone higher than a Major 6th.
- **Step 4**: Raise A♭♭ by one semitone → A♭.
- **Answer**: The note is `Ab` (A flat).

#### 5. A Minor 2nd above the fifth note (`EE`):
- **Step 1**: Interval number is a 2nd. Count letter names: E (1), F (2). The letter name is F.
- **Step 2**: The E major scale is: E, F♯, G♯, A, B, C♯, D♯. The 2nd note is F♯.
- **Step 3**: A minor 2nd is one semitone lower than a Major 2nd.
- **Step 4**: Lower F♯ by one semitone → F.
- **Answer**: The note is `F` (F natural).

### Final Answers:
1. Perfect 4th above `BB-X`: `Ebb` (E double flat)
2. Major 3rd above `D#X`: `F𝄪` (F double sharp)
3. Diminished Octave above `GG-X`: `Gbbb` (G triple flat)
4. Augmented 6th above `C-X`: `Ab` (A flat)
5. Minor 2nd above `EE`: `F` (F natural)
