Let’s analyze the provided HumDrum file step by step using the guides.

### 1. **Key of the Melody**
- The key signature is `k[f#c#]`, which indicates **D major** or **B minor**.
- To determine whether it is major or minor, we look for clues such as accidentals or harmonic content.
  - The melody contains a **C#** (raised 7th in B minor) and no other accidentals that suggest a minor key.
  - The harmonic content and the final chord (D major) strongly suggest **D major** as the key.

**Key: D major**

### 2. **Root/Quality Chord Symbol of the Second Last Chord**
- The second last chord is: `2.F#` in the bass and `2.f#) 2.a 2.dd` in the upper voices.
  - The notes are **F#**, **A**, and **D**.
  - The root is **D** (lowest note in root position).
  - The interval from D to F# is a **major third** (4 half steps).
  - The interval from D to A is a **perfect fifth** (7 half steps).
  - This forms a **D major triad**.

**Root/Quality Chord Symbol: D**

### 3. **Root/Quality Chord Symbol of the Last Chord**
- The last chord is: `=||` (end of the piece), which confirms the final chord is the same as the second last chord.
  - The notes are **F#**, **A**, and **D**.
  - This is again a **D major triad**.

**Root/Quality Chord Symbol: D**

### 4. **Functional Chord Symbol for the Second Last Chord**
- In the key of **D major**, the chord **D major** is the **tonic** chord.
- Functional symbol: **I**.

**Functional Chord Symbol: I**

### 5. **Functional Chord Symbol for the Last Chord**
- The last chord is the same as the second last chord: **D major**.
- Functional symbol: **I**.

**Functional Chord Symbol: I**

### 6. **Type of Cadence**
- The cadence is determined by the progression of the final two chords.
- Both the second last and last chords are **D major** (I → I).
- This is not a progression to the dominant (V), so it is not a half cadence.
- Instead, it is a **perfect authentic cadence** (PAC) because it ends on the tonic (I) in root position.

**Type of Cadence: Authentic**

2. **Root/Quality Chord Symbol of the Second Last Chord**: D  
3. **Root/Quality Chord Symbol of the Last Chord**: D  
4. **Functional Chord Symbol for the Second Last Chord**: I  
5. **Functional Chord Symbol for the Last Chord**: I
