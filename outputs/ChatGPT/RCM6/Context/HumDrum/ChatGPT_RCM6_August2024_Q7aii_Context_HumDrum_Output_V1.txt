### Step 1: Determine the Key

#### 1. Check the Key Signature
The key signature in the file is `*k[b-e-a-d-g-]`, which indicates **five flats**. Referring to the table provided:
- Five flats correspond to **D♭ Major** or **B♭ Minor**.

#### 2. Determine if the Key is Major or Minor
To decide between D♭ Major and B♭ Minor, we look for clues in the music:
- In minor keys, the raised seventh degree (leading tone) is often present. For B♭ Minor, the raised seventh would be **A♮** (instead of A♭).
- In the provided music, there is no A♮ present, and the accidentals align with the key signature of D♭ Major. Additionally, the melodic and harmonic content does not emphasize the minor mode.

#### 3. Conclusion
The key of the piece is **D♭ Major**.

### Step 2: Determine the Time Signature

#### 1. Identify the Rhythmic Values
We analyze the rhythmic values in each measure:

- **Measure 1**:
  - `8a-`: An eighth note = 0.5 beats.
  - Total = 0.5 beats.

- **Measure 2**:
  - `8dd-L`, `8dd-J`, `8ffL`, `8ffJ`: Four eighth notes = 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 = 2 beats.
  - Total = 2 beats.

- **Measure 3**:
  - `4dd-`: A quarter note = 1 beat.
  - `8a-L`, `8a-J`: Two eighth notes = 0.5 + 0.5 = 1 beat.
  - Total = 1 + 1 = 2 beats.

- **Measure 4**:
  - `8.a-L`: A dotted eighth note = 0.75 beats.
  - `16a-Jk`: A sixteenth note = 0.25 beats.
  - `16ee-LL`, `16dd-`, `16cc`, `16b-JJ`: Four sixteenth notes = 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 = 1 beat.
  - Total = 0.75 + 0.25 + 1 = 2 beats.

- **Measure 5**:
  - `4a-`: A quarter note = 1 beat.
  - Total = 1 beat.

#### 2. Analyze the Beat Groupings
The rhythmic values in each measure suggest **simple time** (beats are grouped in twos or fours, not threes). The smallest beat unit is the **eighth note** (0.5 beats), and the measures consistently add up to **2 beats**.

#### 3. Determine the Bottom Number
Since the smallest beat unit is an eighth note, the bottom number of the time signature is **8**.

#### 4. Count the Total Beats in Each Measure
Each measure contains **2 beats** (as calculated above). The top number of the time signature is therefore **2**.

#### 5. Conclusion
The time signature is **2/8**.

### Final Answer:
- **Key**: D♭ Major
- **Time Signature**: 2/8
