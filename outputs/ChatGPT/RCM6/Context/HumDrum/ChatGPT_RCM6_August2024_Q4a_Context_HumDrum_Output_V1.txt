To transpose the melody up a minor sixth, we need to raise each note by the interval of a minor sixth while maintaining the correct accidentals and rhythms. The original key is **E major** (key signature: F#, C#, G#, D#). Transposing up a minor sixth from E major results in the key of **C minor** (key signature: Bb, Eb, Ab).

Here is the transposed melody in **C minor**:

### Explanation of the Transposition:
1. **Key Signature**: The original key of E major (F#, C#, G#, D#) becomes C minor (Bb, Eb, Ab).
2. **Notes**:
   - E → G
   - G# → Bb
   - B → D
   - D# → F
   - F# → Ab
   - C# → Eb
   - A → C
3. **Rhythms**: The rhythms remain unchanged.
4. **Double-checking accidentals**: Accidentals are adjusted to fit the new key signature.

The new key is **C minor**.
