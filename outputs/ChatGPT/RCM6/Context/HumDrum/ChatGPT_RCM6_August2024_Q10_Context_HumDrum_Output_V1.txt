Here are the answers to the questions based on the provided HumDrum file and the guides:

1. **Key of the piece**:  
   The key signature indicates **B♭ minor** (5 flats: B♭, E♭, A♭, D♭, G♭). This is confirmed by the presence of accidentals like A♮ and G♮, which suggest the use of the harmonic minor scale.

2. **Time signature**:  
   The rhythmic groupings suggest **6/8** time. The eighth notes are grouped in sets of three, indicating compound duple meter.

3. **Chord outlined by the first three eighth notes of the second bar (in both hands)**:  
   The notes are **F, A♭, and D♭**. In the key of B♭ minor, these correspond to the **subdominant triad (iv)**.

   The notes are **D♭** (last eighth note of bar 2) and **E♭** (first note of bar 3). The interval is a **major second**.

5. **Functional chord symbol for the chord outlined by the first three eighth notes of bar 5 (in both hands)**:
