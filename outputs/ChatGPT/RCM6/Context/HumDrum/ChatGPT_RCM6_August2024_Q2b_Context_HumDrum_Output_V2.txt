To determine the time signature of the encoded music in the provided HumDrum file, we will analyze the rhythmic groupings and total note values in each measure. Letâ€™s proceed step by step.

---

### Measure 1 (`=1` to `=`):
#### Notes and Rhythms:
- `4.f` = Dotted quarter note = 1.5 beats.
- `8f` = Eighth note = 0.5 beats.
- `16fLL` = Sixteenth note = 0.25 beats.
- `16fJ` = Sixteenth note = 0.25 beats.
- `8fJ` = Eighth note = 0.5 beats.
- `8fL` = Eighth note = 0.5 beats.
- `8fJ` = Eighth note = 0.5 beats.

#### Total Rhythmic Value:
1.5 (dotted quarter) + 0.5 (eighth) + 0.25 (sixteenth) + 0.25 (sixteenth) + 0.5 (eighth) + 0.5 (eighth) + 0.5 (eighth) = **4 beats**.

#### Beam Groupings:
The notes are grouped in a way that suggests **simple time** (not compound). The beat unit appears to be a **quarter note**.

#### Time Signature:
- Total beats = 4.
- Beat unit = quarter note.
- **Time signature = 4/4**.

### Measure 2 (`=` to `==`):
#### Notes and Rhythms:
- `16fLL` = Sixteenth note = 0.25 beats.
- `16f` = Sixteenth note = 0.25 beats.
- `32fL` = Thirty-second note = 0.125 beats.
- `32fJJJ` = Thirty-second note = 0.125 beats.
- `16.fLL` = Dotted sixteenth note = 0.375 beats.
- `32fK` = Thirty-second note = 0.125 beats.
- `16fJJ` = Sixteenth note = 0.25 beats.
- `8fL` = Eighth note = 0.5 beats.
- `16fJk` = Sixteenth note = 0.25 beats.

#### Total Rhythmic Value:
0.25 (sixteenth) + 0.25 (sixteenth) + 0.125 (thirty-second) + 0.125 (thirty-second) + 0.375 (dotted sixteenth) + 0.125 (thirty-second) + 0.25 (sixteenth) + 0.5 (eighth) + 0.25 (sixteenth) = **2 beats**.

#### Beam Groupings:
The notes are grouped in a way that suggests **simple time**. The beat unit appears to be an **eighth note**.

#### Time Signature:
- Total beats = 2.
- Beat unit = eighth note.
- **Time signature = 2/8**.

### Summary of Time Signatures:
- Measure 1: **4/4**.
- Measure 2: **2/8**.
