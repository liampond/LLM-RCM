### Step 1: Determine the Key

#### 1. Check the Key Signature
The key signature in the file is `*k[f#]`, which indicates one sharp (F#). According to the key signature table:
- 1 sharp corresponds to **G Major** or **E Minor**.

#### 2. Determine if the Key is Major or Minor
To distinguish between G Major and E Minor, we look for the raised seventh degree in E Minor (D#). In the file, there is a `16d#X` in the second measure, which is the raised seventh degree of E Minor. This suggests the piece is in **E Minor**.

#### 3. Look for Other Clues
The melodic content emphasizes E Minor, with frequent appearances of E, G, and B (the tonic triad of E Minor). There is no strong evidence of G Major tonicization.

**Key: E Minor**

### Step 2: Determine the Time Signature

#### Step 1: Identify the Beat Groupings
We analyze the rhythmic groupings in each measure:

**Measure 1:**
- `16r` (rest) + `16gLL` + `16a` + `16b` + `16cc` + `16aJJ`
  - Total: 6 sixteenth notes = 6 × 0.25 = **1.5 beats**.

**Measure 2:**
- `16bLL` + `16g` + `16f#` + `16e` + `16d#X` + `16aJJ`
  - Total: 6 sixteenth notes = 6 × 0.25 = **1.5 beats**.

**Measure 3:**
- `32gLLL` + `32f#J` + `16eJ` + `8eeJ` + `8r`
  - `32gLLL` = 0.125, `32f#J` = 0.125, `16eJ` = 0.25, `8eeJ` = 0.5, `8r` = 0.5.
  - Total: 0.125 + 0.125 + 0.25 + 0.5 + 0.5 = **1.5 beats**.

**Measure 4:**
- `32dd#XLLL` + `32cc#XJ` + `16bJ` + `8aaJ` + `8r`
  - `32dd#XLLL` = 0.125, `32cc#XJ` = 0.125, `16bJ` = 0.25, `8aaJ` = 0.5, `8r` = 0.5.
  - Total: 0.125 + 0.125 + 0.25 + 0.5 + 0.5 = **1.5 beats**.

#### Step 2: Check the Total Value of the Beam Groupings
Each measure adds up to **1.5 beats**. This suggests **compound time**, as the total value is divisible by 3 smaller beats.

#### Step 3: Determine the Bottom Number
The smallest rhythmic value is a sixteenth note (0.25 beats). In compound time, the bottom number corresponds to the value of one smaller beat:
- A sixteenth note = 0.25 beats → Bottom number = 16.

#### Step 4: Count the Total Beats in the Measure
Each measure contains **1.5 beats**, which equals **3 smaller beats** (in compound time). The top number is therefore **3**.

#### Step 5: Write the Time Signature
Combine the top number (3 smaller beats) with the bottom number (16 for sixteenth notes). The time signature is:
**3/16**

### Summary

- **Key:** E Minor
- **Time Signature:** 3/16
