### Step 1: Determine the Key of the Piece
#### 1. Check the Key Signature
The key signature is `*k[f#c#g#]`, which indicates three sharps. According to the key signature table:
- Three sharps correspond to **A Major** or **F♯ Minor**.

#### 2. Determine if the Key is Major or Minor
To decide between A Major and F♯ Minor, we look for accidentals or melodic/harmonic clues:
- The melody contains a **G♯** (raised seventh degree of F♯ Minor) in bar 3, which strongly suggests **F♯ Minor**.
- Additionally, the melodic content emphasizes F♯ as a tonic note (e.g., the repeated F♯s in bars 1 and 4).

**Key: F♯ Minor**

### Step 2: Determine the Time Signature
#### 1. Analyze the Rhythmic Groupings
Each bar contains the following rhythmic values:
- **Bar 1:** 4th note + 8th note + 8th note + 8th note + 8th note = 4 beats.
- **Bar 2:** 4th note + 8th note + 8th note + 8th note + 8th note = 4 beats.
- **Bar 3:** 8th note + 8th note + 8th note + 8th note + 8th note + 8th note = 4 beats.
- **Bar 4:** 2nd dotted note = 3 beats (but this is an exception due to phrasing).

#### 2. Determine the Beat Value
- The smallest rhythmic unit is the **8th note** (0.5 beats).
- Each bar (except the last) adds up to **4 beats**, with each beat represented by a **quarter note**.

#### 3. Write the Time Signature
The time signature is **4/4** (common time).

**Time Signature: 4/4**

### Step 3: Determine the Root/Quality Chord Symbols for Each Bar
#### Bar 1: Notes = F♯, C♯, A, B, C♯
1. **Identify Notes and Metric Placement:**
   - Strong beats: F♯ (beat 1), A (beat 3).
   - Weak beats: C♯ (beat 2), B (beat 4), C♯ (beat 4.5).

2. **Differentiate Chord Tones and Non-Chord Tones:**
   - F♯, A, and C♯ form an **F♯ Minor triad** (root: F♯, minor third: A, perfect fifth: C♯).
   - B is a passing tone.

**Chord: F♯ Minor (F♯m)**

---

#### Bar 2: Notes = D, B, F♯, E, D
1. **Identify Notes and Metric Placement:**
   - Strong beats: D (beat 1), F♯ (beat 3).
   - Weak beats: B (beat 2), E (beat 4), D (beat 4.5).

2. **Differentiate Chord Tones and Non-Chord Tones:**
   - D, F♯, and B form a **B Minor triad** (root: B, minor third: D, perfect fifth: F♯).
   - E is a passing tone.

**Chord: B Minor (Bm)**

---

#### Bar 3: Notes = C♯, D♯, E♯, G♯, F♯, E♯
1. **Identify Notes and Metric Placement:**
   - Strong beats: C♯ (beat 1), E♯ (beat 3).
   - Weak beats: D♯ (beat 2), G♯ (beat 4), F♯ (beat 4.5), E♯ (beat 4.75).

2. **Differentiate Chord Tones and Non-Chord Tones:**
   - C♯, E♯, and G♯ form a **C♯ Major triad** (root: C♯, major third: E♯, perfect fifth: G♯).
   - D♯ and F♯ are passing tones.

**Chord: C♯ Major (C♯)**

---

#### Bar 4: Notes = F♯
1. **Identify Notes and Metric Placement:**
   - The only note is F♯, sustained as a dotted half note.

2. **Differentiate Chord Tones and Non-Chord Tones:**
   - The sustained F♯ strongly implies an **F♯ Minor chord** (root: F♯).

**Chord: F♯ Minor (F♯m)**

---

### Final Answers
- **Key:** F♯ Minor
- **Time Signature:** 4/4
- **Bar 1 Chord:** F♯ Minor (F♯m)
- **Bar 2 Chord:** B Minor (Bm)
- **Bar 3 Chord:** C♯ Major (C♯)
- **Bar 4 Chord:** F♯ Minor (F♯m)
