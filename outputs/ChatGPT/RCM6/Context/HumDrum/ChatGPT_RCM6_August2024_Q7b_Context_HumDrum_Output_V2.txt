### Step 1: Determine the Key of the Piece
#### 1. Check the Key Signature
The key signature is `*k[f#c#g#]`, which indicates three sharps. According to the key signature table:
- Three sharps correspond to either **A Major** or **F# Minor**.

#### 2. Determine if the Key is Major or Minor
To decide between A Major and F# Minor, we look for the presence of a raised seventh degree (E# in F# Minor) or melodic/harmonic content that emphasizes one key over the other:
- In bar 3, the melody includes `ee#` (E#), which is the raised seventh degree of F# Minor.
- This strongly suggests the piece is in **F# Minor**.

#### Final Key: **F# Minor**

### Step 2: Determine the Time Signature
#### 1. Analyze the Rhythmic Groupings
Each bar contains the following rhythmic values:
- **Bar 1**: 4th note + 8th note + 8th note + 8th note + 8th note = 4 beats.
- **Bar 2**: 4th note + 8th note + 8th note + 8th note + 8th note = 4 beats.
- **Bar 3**: 8th note + 8th note + 8th note + 8th note + 8th note + 8th note = 4 beats.
- **Bar 4**: 2 dotted quarter notes = 3 beats.

#### 2. Determine the Beat Grouping
- Bars 1–3 suggest **simple time** with 4 beats per measure, where each beat is a quarter note.
- Bar 4 suggests **compound time** with 3 beats per measure, where each beat is a dotted quarter note.

#### 3. Resolve the Time Signature
The majority of the piece (bars 1–3) is in **4/4 time**. Bar 4 may represent a temporary shift to **3/8 time**, but the overall time signature is likely **4/4**.

#### Final Time Signature: **4/4**

### Step 3: Determine the Root/Quality Chord Symbols for Each Bar
#### Bar 1:
- Notes: `ff#`, `cc#`, `a`, `b`, `cc#`.
- Strong beats: `ff#` (beat 1) and `a` (beat 3).
- Chord tones: `ff#`, `a`, `cc#` form an **F# Minor triad** (F#-A-C#).
- Non-chord tones: `b` is a passing tone.

**Chord Symbol for Bar 1: F#m**

---

#### Bar 2:
- Notes: `dd`, `b`, `ff#`, `ee`, `dd`.
- Strong beats: `dd` (beat 1) and `ff#` (beat 3).
- Chord tones: `dd`, `ff#`, `b` form a **D Major triad** (D-F#-A).
- Non-chord tones: `ee` is a passing tone.

**Chord Symbol for Bar 2: D**

---

#### Bar 3:
- Notes: `cc#`, `dd#`, `ee#`, `gg#`, `ff#`, `ee#`.
- Strong beats: `cc#` (beat 1) and `gg#` (beat 3).
- Chord tones: `cc#`, `ee#`, `gg#` form a **C# Augmented triad** (C#-E#-G#).
- Non-chord tones: `dd#` and `ff#` are passing tones.

**Chord Symbol for Bar 3: C#+**

---

#### Bar 4:
- Notes: `ff#`.
- Strong beats: `ff#` (beat 1).
- Chord tones: Only `ff#` is present, suggesting an **F# Minor chord** (F#-A-C#).

**Chord Symbol for Bar 4: F#m**

---

### Summary
- **Key**: F# Minor
- **Time Signature**: 4/4
- **Chord Symbols**:
  - Bar 1: F#m
  - Bar 2: D
  - Bar 3: C#+
  - Bar 4: F#m

This piece is in F# Minor, primarily in 4/4 time, with a harmonic progression that alternates between F# Minor, D Major, and C# Augmented chords. The melody emphasizes the raised seventh degree (E#), confirming the minor key.
