To transpose the melody from the original key of E major to A♭ major, we first determine the interval of transposition.

### Step 1: Determine the Interval of Transposition
- The original key is **E major**.
- The target key is **A♭ major**.
- Count the letter names from E to A: E (1), F (2), G (3), A (4). This is a **fourth**.
- Compare the accidentals: E major has 4 sharps (F♯, C♯, G♯, D♯), and A♭ major has 4 flats (B♭, E♭, A♭, D♭). Moving from E major to A♭ major involves **lowering each note by a diminished fourth** (a Perfect fourth lowered by one semitone).

### Step 2: Transpose the Notes
We will lower each note by a diminished fourth. The new key signature for A♭ major (4 flats: B♭, E♭, A♭, D♭) will replace the original key signature of E major.

#### Measure-by-Measure Transposition:
1. **Measure 1:**
   - Original: 2e → Transposed: 2a♭
   - Original: 4g# → Transposed: 4c
   - Original: 4b → Transposed: 4e♭

2. **Measure 2:**
   - Original: 4.d# → Transposed: 4.f
   - Original: 16eLL → Transposed: 16a♭LL
   - Original: 16f#JJ → Transposed: 16b♭JJ
   - Original: 4e → Transposed: 4a♭
   - Original: 4r → Transposed: 4r (rests remain unchanged).

3. **Measure 3:**
   - Original: 2cc# → Transposed: 2f♭f
   - Original: 4b → Transposed: 4e♭
   - Original: 4ee → Transposed: 4a♭a♭

4. **Measure 4:**
   - Original: 4b → Transposed: 4e♭
   - Original: 8aL → Transposed: 8d♭L
   - Original: 16g#L → Transposed: 16cL
   - Original: 16aJJ → Transposed: 16d♭JJ
   - Original: 4g# → Transposed: 4c
   - Original: 4r → Transposed: 4r.

### Final Answer:
The interval of transposition is a **diminished fourth** (E to A♭). The melody has been transposed accurately into A♭ major with the correct key signature and note adjustments.
