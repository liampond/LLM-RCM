### Step 1: Determine the Key

#### 1. Check the Key Signature
The key signature in the MusicXML file specifies **1 sharp** (`<fifths>1</fifths>`). According to the key signature table:
- 1 sharp corresponds to **G Major** or **E Minor**.

#### 2. Determine if the Key is Major or Minor
To distinguish between G Major and E Minor, we look for the presence of a **raised seventh degree** (D♯ in E Minor) or other clues:
- In Measure 2, there is a **D♯** (`<step>D</step><alter>1</alter>` with `<accidental>sharp</accidental>`), which is the raised seventh degree in E Minor.
- This suggests the piece is in **E Minor**.

#### 3. Look for Other Clues
- The melodic content emphasizes notes from the E Minor scale (E, F♯, G, A, B, C, D♯).
- The presence of D♯ strongly supports E Minor over G Major.

**Key: E Minor**

### Step 2: Determine the Time Signature

#### Step 1: Identify the Beat Groupings
We analyze the rhythmic groupings in the measures:

##### Measure 1:
- The measure contains **16th notes** and a **16th rest**.
- The notes are grouped into beams of **5 consecutive 16th notes** (G4, A4, B4, C5, A4).
- Total rhythmic value:
  - Each 16th note = 1/4 of a beat.
  - 5 × 1/4 = **1.25 beats**.

##### Measure 2:
- The measure contains **16th notes** grouped into beams of **6 consecutive 16th notes** (B4, G4, F♯4, E4, D♯4, A4).
- Total rhythmic value:
  - Each 16th note = 1/4 of a beat.
  - 6 × 1/4 = **1.5 beats**.

##### Measure 3:
- The measure contains a mix of **32nd notes**, **16th notes**, and **eighth notes**:
  - G4 (32nd), F♯4 (32nd), E4 (16th), E5 (eighth), and an eighth rest.
  - Total rhythmic value:
    - 32nd notes = 1/8 of a beat each.
    - 16th note = 1/4 of a beat.
    - Eighth note = 1/2 of a beat.
    - Rest = 1/2 of a beat.
    - Total = 1/8 + 1/8 + 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/2 = **1.5 beats**.

##### Measure 4:
- The measure contains a mix of **32nd notes**, **16th notes**, **eighth notes**, and an eighth rest:
  - D♯5 (32nd), C♯5 (32nd), B4 (16th), A5 (eighth), and an eighth rest.
  - Total rhythmic value:
    - 32nd notes = 1/8 of a beat each.
    - 16th note = 1/4 of a beat.
    - Eighth note = 1/2 of a beat.
    - Rest = 1/2 of a beat.
    - Total = 1/8 + 1/8 + 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/2 = **1.5 beats**.

#### Step 2: Check the Total Value of the Beam Groupings
- The rhythmic groupings suggest **compound time** because the notes are grouped into sets of **3 smaller beats** (e.g., 3 sixteenth notes = 1 beat in compound time).

#### Step 3: Count the Total Beats in the Measure
- Each measure contains **1.5 beats** in compound time, where each beat is divided into three smaller beats.

#### Step 4: Write the Time Signature
- In compound time, the bottom number represents the smallest beat value. Here, the smallest beat is a **16th note**, so the bottom number is **16**.
- The top number represents the total number of smaller beats in the measure. Each measure contains **9 sixteenth notes** (3 groups of 3 sixteenth notes), so the top number is **9**.

**Time Signature: 9/16**

### Final Answer:
- **Key:** E Minor
- **Time Signature:** 9/16
