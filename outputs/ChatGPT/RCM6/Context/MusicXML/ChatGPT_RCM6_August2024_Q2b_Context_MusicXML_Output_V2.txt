To determine the time signature of the measures in the provided MusicXML file, I will analyze the rhythmic groupings and total durations in each measure.

### Measure 1 Analysis:
1. **Notes and Durations**:
   - Dotted quarter note (F4): 1.5 beats
   - Eighth note (F4): 0.5 beats
   - Two 16th notes (F4): 0.25 + 0.25 = 0.5 beats
   - Eighth note (F4): 0.5 beats
   - Two eighth notes (F4): 0.5 + 0.5 = 1 beat

2. **Total Duration**:
   - 1.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 1 = **4 beats**

3. **Beat Grouping**:
   - The notes are grouped into clear subdivisions of 1 beat each (e.g., dotted quarter = 1.5 beats, eighth = 0.5 beats, etc.).
   - The smallest subdivision is the 16th note, but the beat unit is clearly a **quarter note**.

4. **Time Signature**:
   - Total beats = 4
   - Beat unit = quarter note
   - **Time signature: 4/4**

### Measure 2 Analysis:
1. **Notes and Durations**:
   - Two 16th notes (F4): 0.25 + 0.25 = 0.5 beats
   - Two 32nd notes (F4): 0.125 + 0.125 = 0.25 beats
   - Dotted 16th note (F4): 0.375 beats
   - 32nd note (F4): 0.125 beats
   - Dotted 16th note (F4): 0.375 beats
   - Eighth note (F4): 0.5 beats
   - 16th note (F4): 0.25 beats
   - Eighth note (F4): 0.5 beats

2. **Total Duration**:
   - Adding all durations: 0.5 + 0.25 + 0.375 + 0.125 + 0.375 + 0.5 + 0.25 + 0.5 = **4 beats**

3. **Beat Grouping**:
   - The notes are grouped into subdivisions of 1 beat each, with the smallest subdivision being the 16th note.
   - The beat unit is a **quarter note**.

4. **Time Signature**:
   - Total beats = 4
   - Beat unit = quarter note
   - **Time signature: 4/4**

### Final Answer:
Both measures are in **4/4 time**.
