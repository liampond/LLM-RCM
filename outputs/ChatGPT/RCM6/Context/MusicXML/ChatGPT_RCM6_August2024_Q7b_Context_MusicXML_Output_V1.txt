### Step 1: Determine the Key of the Piece
#### 1. Check the Key Signature
The key signature in the MusicXML file indicates **3 sharps**. According to the key signature table:
- 3 sharps correspond to either **A Major** or **F♯ Minor**.

#### 2. Determine if the Key is Major or Minor
To decide between A Major and F♯ Minor, we look for accidentals or melodic/harmonic clues:
- In bar 3, there is a **D♯** (altered seventh degree of F♯ Minor), which strongly suggests the use of the harmonic minor scale.
- The melody also emphasizes F♯ as a tonic note (e.g., F♯ appears prominently in bar 3 and bar 4).

Thus, the key is **F♯ Minor**.

### Step 2: Determine the Time Signature
#### 1. Analyze the Rhythmic Groupings
- **Bar 1**:
  - Quarter note (1 beat) + 3 eighth notes (1.5 beats) = 2.5 beats.
  - Total rhythmic value = 3 beats.
- **Bar 2**:
  - Quarter note (1 beat) + 3 eighth notes (1.5 beats) = 2.5 beats.
  - Total rhythmic value = 3 beats.
- **Bar 3**:
  - 6 eighth notes (3 beats).
  - Total rhythmic value = 3 beats.
- **Bar 4**:
  - Dotted half note (3 beats).
  - Total rhythmic value = 3 beats.

#### 2. Determine the Beat Grouping
- Each measure consistently adds up to **3 beats**.
- The smallest rhythmic unit is the **eighth note**, so the bottom number of the time signature is **8**.

#### 3. Write the Time Signature
The time signature is **3/8** (compound meter with 3 beats per measure, each beat being an eighth note).

### Step 3: Determine the Root/Quality Chord Symbols for Each Bar
#### Bar 1:
- Notes: F♯, C♯, A, B.
- Strong beats: F♯ (beat 1), A (beat 3).
- Chord tones: F♯, A, C♯ (F♯ Minor triad).
- Non-chord tone: B (passing tone between A and C♯).

**Chord Symbol: F♯m (F♯ Minor)**.

---

#### Bar 2:
- Notes: D, B, F♯, E.
- Strong beats: D (beat 1), F♯ (beat 3).
- Chord tones: D, F♯, B (B Minor triad in first inversion: B-D-F♯).
- Non-chord tone: E (passing tone between F♯ and D).

**Chord Symbol: Bm (B Minor)**.

---

#### Bar 3:
- Notes: C♯, D♯, E♯, G♯, F♯.
- Strong beats: C♯ (beat 1), G♯ (beat 4).
- Chord tones: C♯, E♯, G♯ (C♯ Major triad).
- Non-chord tones: D♯ (passing tone between C♯ and E♯), F♯ (passing tone between G♯ and E♯).

**Chord Symbol: C♯ (C♯ Major)**.

---

#### Bar 4:
- Notes: F♯ (sustained).
- Strong beat: F♯ (beat 1).
- Chord tones: F♯ (root of F♯ Minor triad).

**Chord Symbol: F♯m (F♯ Minor)**.

---

### Final Answer:
- **Key**: F♯ Minor.
- **Time Signature**: 3/8.
- **Chord Symbols**:
  - Bar 1: **F♯m**.
  - Bar 2: **Bm**.
  - Bar 3: **C♯**.
  - Bar 4: **F♯m**.
