### Step 1: Determine the Key of the Piece

#### 1. Check the Key Signature
The `<key>` element in the MusicXML file specifies `<fifths>-5</fifths>`. This indicates a key signature with 5 flats. Referring to the table provided:
- 5 flats correspond to **D♭ Major** or **B♭ Minor**.

#### 2. Determine if the Key is Major or Minor
To decide between D♭ Major and B♭ Minor, we look for the raised seventh degree (A♮) in the case of B♭ Minor. However:
- The notes in the piece include A♭, D♭, and B♭, which align with the D♭ Major scale.
- There is no evidence of a raised seventh (A♮) or other minor key characteristics.

Thus, the key is **D♭ Major**.

### Step 2: Determine the Time Signature

#### Measure-by-Measure Analysis of Rhythms

##### Measure 1
- Notes: Two D♭5 eighth notes (each = 0.5 beats), two F5 eighth notes (each = 0.5 beats).
- Total rhythmic value: 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 = **2 beats**.

##### Measure 2
- Notes: One D♭5 quarter note (1 beat), two A♭4 eighth notes (each = 0.5 beats).
- Total rhythmic value: 1 + 0.5 + 0.5 = **2 beats**.

##### Measure 3
- Notes: 
  - A♭4 dotted eighth note (0.75 beats), A♭4 sixteenth note (0.25 beats) = 1 beat.
  - E♭5 sixteenth note (0.25 beats), D♭5 sixteenth note (0.25 beats), C5 sixteenth note (0.25 beats), B♭4 sixteenth note (0.25 beats) = 1 beat.
- Total rhythmic value: 1 + 1 = **2 beats**.

##### Measure 4
- Notes: One A♭4 quarter note (1 beat).
- Total rhythmic value: **1 beat** (this measure is incomplete, likely a pickup or final cadence).

#### Step 3: Determine the Beat Groupings
- Each measure (except the last) contains **2 beats**.
- The smallest note value is a sixteenth note (0.25 beats), but the beats are grouped into eighth notes (0.5 beats each).
- This suggests **simple time** with eighth notes as the beat unit.

#### Step 4: Write the Time Signature
- The top number is **2** (2 beats per measure).
- The bottom number is **8** (eighth note as the beat unit).

The time signature is **2/8**.

- **Key**: D♭ Major
- **Time Signature**: 2/8
