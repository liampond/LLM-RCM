Let’s analyze the notes in the MusicXML file and determine the requested intervals step by step.

### Notes in the File:
1. **First note**: B♭2 (Measure 1)
2. **Second note**: D♯3 (Measure 2)
3. **Third note**: G♭2 (Measure 3)
4. **Fourth note**: C♭3 (Measure 4)
5. **Fifth note**: E2 (Measure 5)

### 1. A Perfect 4th above the first note (B♭2):
- **Step 1**: Count the interval number:
  B (1), C (2), D (3), E (4). The letter name is E.
- **Step 2**: Use the B♭ major scale: B♭, C, D, E♭, F, G, A.
  The 4th note in the scale is E♭, which is a Perfect 4th.
- **Final Answer**: A Perfect 4th above B♭2 is **E♭3**.

### 2. A Major 3rd above the second note (D♯3):
- **Step 1**: Count the interval number:
  D (1), E (2), F (3). The letter name is F.
- **Step 2**: Use the D♯ major scale: D♯, E♯, F♯, G♯, A♯, B♯, C♯.
  The 3rd note in the scale is F♯, which is a Major 3rd.
- **Final Answer**: A Major 3rd above D♯3 is **F♯3**.

### 3. A Diminished Octave above the third note (G♭2):
- **Step 1**: Count the interval number:
  G (1), A (2), B (3), C (4), D (5), E (6), F (7), G (8). The letter name is G.
- **Step 2**: Use the G♭ major scale: G♭, A♭, B♭, C♭, D♭, E♭, F, G♭.
  The octave is G♭, which is a Perfect Octave.
- **Step 3**: Lower the Perfect Octave by one semitone to make it Diminished.
  G♭ lowered by one semitone is **F♮**.
- **Final Answer**: A Diminished Octave above G♭2 is **F3**.

### 4. An Augmented 6th above the fourth note (C♭3):
- **Step 1**: Count the interval number:
  C (1), D (2), E (3), F (4), G (5), A (6). The letter name is A.
- **Step 2**: Use the C♭ major scale: C♭, D♭, E♭, F♭, G♭, A♭, B♭.
  The 6th note in the scale is A♭, which is a Major 6th.
- **Step 3**: Raise the Major 6th by one semitone to make it Augmented.
  A♭ raised by one semitone is **A♮**.
- **Final Answer**: An Augmented 6th above C♭3 is **A3**.

### 5. A Minor 2nd above the final note (E2):
- **Step 1**: Count the interval number:
  E (1), F (2). The letter name is F.
- **Step 2**: Use the E major scale: E, F♯, G♯, A, B, C♯, D♯.
  The 2nd note in the scale is F♯, which is a Major 2nd.
- **Step 3**: Lower the Major 2nd by one semitone to make it Minor.
  F♯ lowered by one semitone is **F♮**.
- **Final Answer**: A Minor 2nd above E2 is **F2**.

### Final Results:
1. A Perfect 4th above B♭2 → **E♭3**  
2. A Major 3rd above D♯3 → **F♯3**  
3. A Diminished Octave above G♭2 → **F3**  
4. An Augmented 6th above C♭3 → **A3**  
5. A Minor 2nd above E2 → **F2**
