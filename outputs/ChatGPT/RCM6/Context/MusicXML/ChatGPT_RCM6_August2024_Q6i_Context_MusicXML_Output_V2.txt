### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Melody

#### 1. **Key of the Melody**
- The key signature has **3 flats**.
- According to the key signature chart:
  - 3 flats correspond to **E♭ major** or **C minor**.
- To determine whether the melody is in E♭ major or C minor:
  - Look for accidentals that indicate a raised 7th degree (B♮ in C minor).
  - The melody contains **B♮** (e.g., in measure 2 and measure 4), which is the raised 7th degree in C minor.
  - The melody also emphasizes **C** as a tonic note (e.g., measure 1 and measure 3).
- Therefore, the key is **C minor**.

#### 2. **Root/Quality Chord Symbol of the Second Last Chord**
- The second last chord (measure 4, treble staff) contains the notes:
  - **G (bass), B♮, D**.
- Step-by-step:
  - The root is **G** (lowest note).
  - The third above G is **B♮** (4 half steps → major third).
  - The fifth above G is **D** (7 half steps → perfect fifth).
  - This is a **G major triad**.
- Root/Quality Chord Symbol: **G**.

#### 3. **Root/Quality Chord Symbol of the Last Chord**
- The last chord (measure 4, treble staff) contains the notes:
  - **G (bass), B♮, D** (same as the second last chord).
- Step-by-step:
  - The root is **G** (lowest note).
  - The third above G is **B♮** (4 half steps → major third).
  - The fifth above G is **D** (7 half steps → perfect fifth).
  - This is a **G major triad**.
- Root/Quality Chord Symbol: **G**.

#### 4. **Functional Chord Symbol for the Second Last Chord**
- The second last chord is **G major**.
- In the key of **C minor**, G is the **dominant (V)** chord.
- Functional Chord Symbol: **V**.

#### 5. **Functional Chord Symbol for the Last Chord**
- The last chord is also **G major**.
- In the key of **C minor**, G is the **dominant (V)** chord.
- Functional Chord Symbol: **V**.

#### 6. **Type of Cadence**
- The cadence ends on the **V (G major)** chord.
- A cadence that ends on the dominant (V) is a **half cadence**.
- Type of Cadence: **Half Cadence**.
