In the bass clef, the ascending and descending **D-flat major scale** includes the following notes, using the key signature of 5 flats (B♭, E♭, A♭, D♭, G♭):

### Ascending:
D♭, E♭, F, G♭, A♭, B♭, C, D♭

### Descending:

The key signature should be written with the 5 flats, and no additional accidentals are necessary.
