In the harmonic form of the E-flat minor scale, the 7th degree is raised by a semitone. Below are the notes for the **ascending** and **descending** E-flat minor harmonic scale in the bass clef, using the key signature of E-flat minor (6 flats: B♭, E♭, A♭, D♭, G♭, and C♭) and any necessary accidentals:

### Ascending:
E♭ - F - G♭ - A♭ - B♭ - C♭ - D♮ - E♭

### Descending:
E♭ - D♮ - C♭ - B♭ - A♭ - G♭ - F - E♭

The raised 7th degree (D♮) is indicated with a natural accidental.
