### Answers:

1. **Key of the Piece**  
   The key signature has one flat, indicating either **F major** or **D minor**. Examining the melodic and harmonic content, the piece emphasizes F as the tonic and lacks the raised 7th (C♯) typical of D minor. Therefore, the key is **F major**.

2. **Time Signature**  
   The rhythmic groupings suggest **6/8** time. Each measure contains two beats, with each beat subdivided into three eighth notes (compound duple meter). This is consistent with the beaming and note durations.

3. **Chord Outlined by the First Three Eighth Notes of Bar 2 (Both Hands)**  
   The notes in the right hand are **D6, B♭5, D6**, and in the left hand are **F3, B♭3, D4**. Together, these form the notes **B♭, D, F**, which outline a **B♭ major triad**. In the key of F major, this is the **subdominant triad**.

4. **Interval Between the Last Eighth Note in the Left Hand of Bar 2 and the First Note in the Left Hand of Bar 3**  
   The last eighth note in the left hand of bar 2 is **D4**, and the first note in the left hand of bar 3 is **E3**. Counting the letter names: D (1), E (2), this is a **second**. Since E is one octave lower than D, the interval is a **minor ninth**.

5. **Functional Chord Symbol for the First Three Eighth Notes of Bar 5 (Both Hands)**  
   The notes in the right hand are **F6, C6, A5**, and in the left hand are **F3, A3, C4**. Together, these form the notes **F, A, C**, which outline an **F major triad**. In the key of F major, this is the **tonic chord (I)**.

6. **Chord Outlined by the Last Three Eighth Notes of Bar 7 (Both Hands)**  
   The notes in the right hand are **B♭5, G5, E5**, and in the left hand are **C3, G3, B♭3**. Together, these form the notes **E, G, B♭**, which outline an **E diminished triad**. In the key of F major, this is the **leading-tone diminished triad (vii°)**.

7. **Interval Between the Second Eighth Note in the Left Hand of Bar 8 and the Third Eighth Note in the Left Hand of Bar 8**  
   The second eighth note in the left hand of bar 8 is **A3**, and the third eighth note is **C4**. Counting the letter names: A (1), B (2), C (3), this is a **third**. Since C is a minor third above A, the interval is a **minor third**.

8. **Rest to Complete Bar 8 in the Right Hand**  
   After the quarter note (F5) in the right hand, there is one eighth note missing to complete the bar. Therefore, an **eighth rest** should be added.

9. **Parallel or Contrasting Period**  
   The passage is a **parallel period**. Both phrases begin with similar melodic material, but the first phrase ends with a weaker cadence (likely a half cadence), and the second phrase ends with a stronger cadence (likely a perfect authentic cadence).

10. **Meaning of Allegretto Vivace**  
    "Allegretto vivace" is a tempo marking. **Allegretto** means moderately fast, slightly slower than Allegro, while **vivace** means lively and brisk. Together, it indicates a **moderately fast and lively tempo**.

### Summary:
The piece is in **F major** and written in **6/8 time**. The harmonic analysis reveals the use of functional chords such as the **subdominant (IV)** in bar 2, the **tonic (I)** in bar 5, and the **leading-tone diminished triad (vii°)** in bar 7. The intervals analyzed include a **minor ninth** and a **minor third**, and the rhythmic structure requires an **eighth rest** to complete bar 8. The passage is a **parallel period**, and the tempo marking **allegretto vivace** suggests a lively, moderately fast pace.
