Let’s analyze the notes in the MusicXML file and determine the requested intervals step by step.

### Notes in the File:
1. **First note**: B♭2 (Measure 1)
2. **Second note**: D♯3 (Measure 2)
3. **Third note**: G♭2 (Measure 3)
4. **Fourth note**: C♭3 (Measure 4)
5. **Fifth note**: E2 (Measure 5)

### Intervals:

#### 1. A Perfect 4th above the first note (B♭2):
- **Step 1**: Count the interval number:
  B♭ (1), C (2), D (3), E♭ (4). The letter name is E♭.
- **Step 2**: Use the B♭ major scale:
  B♭, C, D, E♭, F, G, A. The 4th note is E♭, which is a Perfect 4th.
- **Step 3**: No adjustment is needed for a Perfect interval.
- **Answer**: E♭3.

#### 2. A Major 3rd above the second note (D♯3):
- **Step 1**: Count the interval number:
  D♯ (1), E (2), F (3). The letter name is F.
- **Step 2**: Use the D♯ major scale:
  D♯, E♯, F♯, G♯, A♯, B♯, C♯. The 3rd note is F♯, which is a Major 3rd.
- **Step 3**: Adjust for the accidental:
  F♯ is enharmonic to G♭, but we need F♮ for a Major 3rd above D♯.
