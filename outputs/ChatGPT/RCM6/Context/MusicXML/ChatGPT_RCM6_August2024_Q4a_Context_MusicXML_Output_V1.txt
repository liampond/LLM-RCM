To transpose the melody up a minor sixth, we need to raise each note by the interval of a minor sixth while maintaining the original rhythm. The original key is **E major** (4 sharps: F#, C#, G#, D#). Transposing up a minor sixth from E major results in the key of **C minor** (3 flats: Bb, Eb, Ab). Below is the transposed melody with the correct notes, rhythms, and the new key signature.
