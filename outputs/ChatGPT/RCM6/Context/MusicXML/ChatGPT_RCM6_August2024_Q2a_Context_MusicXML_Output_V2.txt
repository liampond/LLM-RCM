To address the task, I will systematically analyze each measure containing quarter notes with x-shaped noteheads (placeholders) and replace them with appropriate rests, ensuring the measure adheres to the time signature. Below is the step-by-step solution for each measure:

---

### Measure 1: Time Signature 4/2
- **Time Signature**: 4 beats per measure, half note = 1 beat.
- **Provided Notes**:
  - Dotted quarter note (1.5 beats).
  - Placeholder quarter note (1 beat).
  - Sixteenth note (0.25 beats).
- **Analysis**:
  - Total duration of provided notes: 1.5 + 1 + 0.25 = 2.75 beats.
  - Remaining duration: 4 - 2.75 = 1.25 beats.
- **Solution**:
  - Replace the placeholder quarter note with a quarter rest (1 beat).
  - Add a sixteenth rest (0.25 beats) to complete the measure.
- **Final Measure**:
  - Dotted quarter note (1.5 beats), quarter rest (1 beat), sixteenth note (0.25 beats), sixteenth rest (0.25 beats).

### Measure 2: Time Signature 4/2
- **Time Signature**: 4 beats per measure, half note = 1 beat.
- **Provided Notes**:
  - Triplet eighth notes (1 beat).
  - Placeholder quarter note (1 beat).
- **Analysis**:
  - Total duration of provided notes: 1 + 1 = 2 beats.
  - Remaining duration: 4 - 2 = 2 beats.
- **Solution**:
  - Replace the placeholder quarter note with a quarter rest (1 beat).
  - Add a half rest (2 beats) to complete the measure.
- **Final Measure**:
  - Triplet eighth notes (1 beat), quarter rest (1 beat), half rest (2 beats).

### Measure 3: Time Signature 6/4
- **Time Signature**: 6 beats per measure, quarter note = 1 beat.
- **Provided Notes**:
  - Sixteenth note (0.25 beats).
  - Dotted eighth note (0.75 beats).
  - Placeholder quarter note (1 beat).
- **Analysis**:
  - Total duration of provided notes: 0.25 + 0.75 + 1 = 2 beats.
  - Remaining duration: 6 - 2 = 4 beats.
- **Solution**:
  - Replace the placeholder quarter note with a quarter rest (1 beat).
  - Add a whole rest (4 beats) to complete the measure.
- **Final Measure**:
  - Sixteenth note (0.25 beats), dotted eighth note (0.75 beats), quarter rest (1 beat), whole rest (4 beats).

---

### Measure 4: Time Signature 6/4
- **Time Signature**: 6 beats per measure, quarter note = 1 beat.
- **Provided Notes**:
  - Placeholder quarter note (1 beat).
  - Eighth note (0.5 beats).
  - Placeholder quarter note (1 beat).
- **Analysis**:
  - Total duration of provided notes: 1 + 0.5 + 1 = 2.5 beats.
  - Remaining duration: 6 - 2.5 = 3.5 beats.
- **Solution**:
  - Replace each placeholder quarter note with a quarter rest (1 beat each).
  - Add a dotted half rest (3 beats) to complete the measure.
- **Final Measure**:
  - Quarter rest (1 beat), eighth note (0.5 beats), quarter rest (1 beat), dotted half rest (3 beats).

---

### Measure 5: Time Signature 9/8
- **Time Signature**: 9 beats per measure, eighth note = 1 beat.
- **Provided Notes**:
  - Placeholder quarter note (2 beats).
  - Placeholder quarter note (2 beats).
  - Placeholder quarter note (2 beats).
- **Analysis**:
  - Total duration of provided notes: 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 beats.
  - Remaining duration: 9 - 6 = 3 beats.
- **Solution**:
  - Replace each placeholder quarter note with a dotted quarter rest (3 beats each).
  - Add a dotted quarter rest (3 beats) to complete the measure.
- **Final Measure**:
  - Dotted quarter rest (3 beats), dotted quarter rest (3 beats), dotted quarter rest (3 beats).

---

### Measure 6: Time Signature 9/8
- **Time Signature**: 9 beats per measure, eighth note = 1 beat.
- **Provided Notes**:
  - Placeholder quarter note (2 beats).
  - Placeholder quarter note (2 beats).
  - Placeholder quarter note (2 beats).
  - Placeholder quarter note (2 beats).
- **Analysis**:
  - Total duration of provided notes: 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8 beats.
  - Remaining duration: 9 - 8 = 1 beat.
- **Solution**:
  - Replace each placeholder quarter note with a dotted quarter rest (3 beats each).
  - Add an eighth rest (1 beat) to complete the measure.
- **Final Measure**:
  - Dotted quarter rest (3 beats), dotted quarter rest (3 beats), dotted quarter rest (3 beats), eighth rest (1 beat).

---

### Measure 7: Time Signature 3/4
- **Time Signature**: 3 beats per measure, quarter note = 1 beat.
- **Provided Notes**:
  - Placeholder quarter note (1 beat).
- **Analysis**:
  - Total duration of provided notes: 1 beat.
  - Remaining duration: 3 - 1 = 2 beats.
- **Solution**:
  - Replace the placeholder quarter note with a quarter rest (1 beat).
  - Add a half rest (2 beats) to complete the measure.
- **Final Measure**:
  - Quarter rest (1 beat), half rest (2 beats).

---

### Measure 8: Time Signature 3/4
- **Time Signature**: 3 beats per measure, quarter note = 1 beat.
- **Provided Notes**:
  - Placeholder quarter note (1 beat).
  - Placeholder quarter note (1 beat).
- **Analysis**:
  - Total duration of provided notes: 1 + 1 = 2 beats.
  - Remaining duration: 3 - 2 = 1 beat.
- **Solution**:
  - Replace each placeholder quarter note with a quarter rest (1 beat each).
  - Add a quarter rest (1 beat) to complete the measure.
- **Final Measure**:
  - Quarter rest (1 beat), quarter rest (1 beat), quarter rest (1 beat).

### Summary:
For each measure, the placeholder quarter notes were replaced with appropriate rests based on the time signature and beat structure. The measures were completed systematically, ensuring the total duration of notes and rests equaled the full measure.
