### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Melody:

#### 1. **Key of the Melody**
- The key signature has **2 sharps**.
- From the guide, 2 sharps correspond to either **D major** or **B minor**.
- To determine whether the melody is in D major or B minor, we look for clues such as accidentals or the final chord.
  - The final chord contains **D, F♯, and A**, which forms a **D major triad**.
  - This suggests the melody is in **D major**.

**Key:** **D major**

#### 2. **Root/Quality Chord Symbol of the Second Last Chord**
- The second last chord (in measure 3) contains the notes **E, A, and C♯**.
  - The bass note is **E**, but this is not the root because the chord is in **root position** (no inversions indicated).
  - The root is **A** (the note a perfect fifth above E).
- To determine the quality:
  - The third above A is **C♯** (4 half steps → major third).
  - The fifth above A is **E** (7 half steps → perfect fifth).
  - This forms an **A major triad**.

**Root/Quality Chord Symbol of the Second Last Chord:** **A**

#### 3. **Root/Quality Chord Symbol of the Last Chord**
- The last chord (in measure 4) contains the notes **D, F♯, and A**.
  - The bass note is **D**, which is also the root.
- To determine the quality:
  - The third above D is **F♯** (4 half steps → major third).
  - The fifth above D is **A** (7 half steps → perfect fifth).
  - This forms a **D major triad**.

**Root/Quality Chord Symbol of the Last Chord:** **D**

#### 4. **Functional Chord Symbol for the Second Last Chord**
- The second last chord is **A major**.
- In the key of **D major**, A is the **5th scale degree**.
- A major is a **major triad**, so its functional chord symbol is **V**.

**Functional Chord Symbol for the Second Last Chord:** **V**

---

#### 5. **Functional Chord Symbol for the Last Chord**
- The last chord is **D major**.
- In the key of **D major**, D is the **1st scale degree**.
- D major is a **major triad**, so its functional chord symbol is **I**.

**Functional Chord Symbol for the Last Chord:** **I**

#### 6. **Type of Cadence**
- The cadence moves from **A major (V)** to **D major (I)**.
- A cadence that ends on the tonic (I) after a dominant (V) is an **authentic cadence**.

**Type of Cadence:** **Authentic**

### Final Answer:
- **Key of the Melody:** D major  
- **Root/Quality Chord Symbol of the Second Last Chord:** A  
- **Root/Quality Chord Symbol of the Last Chord:** D  
- **Functional Chord Symbol for the Second Last Chord:** V  
- **Functional Chord Symbol for the Last Chord:** I  
- **Type of Cadence:** Authentic
