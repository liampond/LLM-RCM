### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Melody

#### 1. **Key of the Melody**
- The key signature has **2 sharps**.
- From the key signature, the possible keys are **D major** or **B minor**.
- To determine whether the melody is in D major or B minor, we look for clues:
  - The melody emphasizes **D** as a tonic note (e.g., the first note of the melody is D5, and the final chord contains D as the root).
  - There is no consistent use of A♯ (the raised 7th of B minor), which would indicate B minor.
- Therefore, the key is **D major**.

#### 2. **Root/Quality Chord Symbol of the Second Last Chord**
- The second last chord (in measure 3) contains the notes **E4, A4, C♯5**.
- Step-by-step:
  1. The **bass note** is **E4**, but this is not the root because the chord is in **root position** based on the spacing of the notes.
  2. The root is **A** (the note a perfect fifth above E).
  3. The notes **A, C♯, E** form a triad:
     - A to C♯ is a **major third** (4 half steps).
     - A to E is a **perfect fifth** (7 half steps).
  4. This is an **A major triad**.
- The root/quality chord symbol is **A**.

#### 3. **Root/Quality Chord Symbol of the Last Chord**
- The last chord (in measure 4) contains the notes **F♯3, A4, D5**.
- Step-by-step:
  1. The **bass note** is **F♯3**, but this is not the root because the chord is in **root position** based on the spacing of the notes.
  2. The root is **D** (the note a perfect fifth above F♯).
  3. The notes **D, F♯, A** form a triad:
     - D to F♯ is a **major third** (4 half steps).
     - D to A is a **perfect fifth** (7 half steps).
  4. This is a **D major triad**.
- The root/quality chord symbol is **D**.

#### 4. **Functional Chord Symbol for the Second Last Chord**
- The second last chord is **A major**.
- In the key of **D major**, A is the **5th scale degree**.
- A major is the **dominant triad** in D major.
- The functional chord symbol is **V**.

#### 5. **Functional Chord Symbol for the Last Chord**
- The last chord is **D major**.
- In the key of **D major**, D is the **1st scale degree**.
- D major is the **tonic triad** in D major.
- The functional chord symbol is **I**.

#### 6. **Type of Cadence**
- The cadence moves from **V (A major)** to **I (D major)**.
- A cadence that resolves from V to I is an **authentic cadence**.
