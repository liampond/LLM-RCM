To transpose the melody up a **minor sixth**, we need to raise each note by that interval while maintaining the original rhythms. The original key is **E major** (4 sharps: F#, C#, G#, D#). Transposing up a minor sixth moves the key to **C minor** (3 flats: Bb, Eb, Ab). Below is the transposed melody with the correct notes, rhythms, and the new key signature.

### **Explanation of Transposition:**
- Each note was raised by a minor sixth interval.
- Accidentals were adjusted to fit the new key signature of **C minor**.
- Rhythms and note durations remain unchanged.
- The melody now fits within the new key and maintains its original structure.
