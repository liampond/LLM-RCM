### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Melody

#### 1. **Key of the Melody**
- The key signature has **3 flats**.
- According to the key signature chart:
  - 3 flats correspond to **E♭ major** or **C minor**.
- To determine whether the melody is in E♭ major or C minor:
  - Look for accidentals that indicate a raised 7th degree (B♮ in C minor).
  - The melody contains **B♮** (e.g., in measure 2 and measure 4), which is the raised 7th degree in C minor.
  - The melody emphasizes **C minor chords** and ends on a **C minor chord**.
- **Key:** **C minor**.

#### 2. **Root/Quality Chord Symbol of the Second Last Chord**
- The second last chord (measure 3, beat 4) contains the notes:
  - **G (bass), C, E♭**.
- Step-by-step:
  1. **Root:** The bass note is **G**, so the root is **G**.
  2. **Quality:**
     - The third above G is **B♭** (3 half steps → minor third).
     - The fifth above G is **D** (7 half steps → perfect fifth).
     - The chord contains **G, B♭, D**, which forms a **G minor triad**.
- **Root/Quality Chord Symbol:** **Gm** (G minor).
