### Step 1: Determine the Key of the Piece

#### 1. Check the Key Signature
The `<key>` element in the MusicXML file specifies `<fifths>1</fifths>`. This indicates one sharp in the key signature. Referring to the key signature table:
- 1 sharp corresponds to **G Major** or **E Minor**.

#### 2. Determine if the Key is Major or Minor
To distinguish between G Major and E Minor, we look for the raised seventh degree in E Minor (D♯). If present, this would indicate E Minor. However:
- The notes in the piece include G, B, D, and F♯, which strongly suggest the tonic triad of **G Major**.
- There is no D♯ present in the piece, ruling out E Minor.

Thus, the key is **G Major**.

### Step 2: Determine the Time Signature

#### 1. Identify the Beat Groupings
The piece contains primarily **16th notes**, grouped into sets of **4 beamed notes**. Each grouping of 4 sixteenth notes equals **1 beat**.

#### 2. Check the Total Value of the Beam Groupings
Each beam grouping of 4 sixteenth notes equals **1 quarter note (1 beat)**. This indicates **simple time**.

#### 3. Count the Total Beats in the Measure
- Measure 1 contains **16 sixteenth notes**, grouped into 4 sets of 4 sixteenth notes. This equals **4 beats**.
- Measure 2 also contains **16 sixteenth notes**, grouped similarly into 4 beats.

Thus, each measure contains **4 beats**.

#### 4. Determine the Bottom Number
Since each beat is a quarter note, the bottom number of the time signature is **4**.

#### 5. Write the Time Signature
The piece has **4 beats per measure**, with each beat represented by a quarter note. The time signature is **4/4**.

### Summary
- **Key**: G Major
- **Time Signature**: 4/4
