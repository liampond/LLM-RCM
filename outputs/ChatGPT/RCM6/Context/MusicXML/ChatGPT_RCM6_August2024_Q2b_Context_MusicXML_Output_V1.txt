To determine the time signature of the measures in the provided MusicXML file, I will analyze the rhythmic groupings and total note values in each measure.

---

### Measure 1:
1. **Notes and Rhythmic Values**:
   - Dotted quarter note (F4): 1.5 beats
   - Eighth note (F4): 0.5 beats
   - Two 16th notes (F4): 0.25 + 0.25 = 0.5 beats
   - Eighth note (F4): 0.5 beats
   - Two eighth notes (F4): 0.5 + 0.5 = 1 beat

2. **Total Rhythmic Value**:
   - 1.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 4 beats

3. **Beam Groupings**:
   - The notes are grouped in a way that suggests simple time (e.g., eighth notes and 16th notes are grouped in pairs, not in threes).

4. **Bottom Number**:
   - The smallest beat unit is the 16th note (0.25), but the beat groupings suggest that the quarter note (1 beat) is the primary beat unit. Thus, the bottom number is **4**.

5. **Top Number**:
   - The total number of beats in the measure is **4**.

**Time Signature for Measure 1**: **4/4**

### Measure 2:
1. **Notes and Rhythmic Values**:
   - Two 16th notes (F4): 0.25 + 0.25 = 0.5 beats
   - Two 32nd notes (F4): 0.125 + 0.125 = 0.25 beats
   - Dotted 16th note (F4): 0.375 beats
   - 32nd note (F4): 0.125 beats
   - Two 16th notes (F4): 0.25 + 0.25 = 0.5 beats
   - Eighth note (F4): 0.5 beats
   - 16th note (F4): 0.25 beats

2. **Total Rhythmic Value**:
   - 0.5 + 0.25 + 0.375 + 0.125 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.25 = 2.5 beats

3. **Beam Groupings**:
   - The notes are grouped in a way that suggests compound time (e.g., dotted 16th notes and 32nd notes are grouped in threes).

4. **Bottom Number**:
   - The smallest beat unit is the 32nd note (0.125), but the beat groupings suggest that the eighth note (0.5 beats) is the primary beat unit. Thus, the bottom number is **8**.

5. **Top Number**:
   - The total number of beats in the measure is **2.5**, but this is unusual for a standard time signature. It is likely that the measure is incomplete or part of a pickup.

**Time Signature for Measure 2**: Likely **6/8** (compound time with eighth-note subdivisions).

### Final Answer:
- **Measure 1**: **4/4**
- **Measure 2**: Likely **6/8**
