### Step 1: Determine the Key of the Piece

#### 1. Check the Key Signature
The `<key>` element in the MusicXML file specifies `<fifths>-5</fifths>`. This means there are **five flats** in the key signature. Referring to the key signature table:

- **Five flats** correspond to **D♭ Major** or **B♭ Minor**.

#### 2. Determine if the Key is Major or Minor
To decide between D♭ Major and B♭ Minor, we look for clues in the music:
- In minor keys, the raised seventh degree is often present. For B♭ Minor, the raised seventh would be **A♮** (instead of A♭).
- The notes in the piece include **A♭** consistently, with no A♮ present. This suggests the piece is not in B♭ Minor.
- The melodic and harmonic content does not emphasize minor triads or progressions typical of minor keys.

Thus, the key is **D♭ Major**.

### Step 2: Determine the Time Signature

#### Step 1: Identify the Beat Groupings
We analyze the rhythmic groupings in each measure to infer the beat structure.

- **Measure 1:**
  - The measure contains four eighth notes (D♭5, D♭5, F5, F5), grouped into two pairs of beamed eighth notes.
  - Total rhythmic value = 4 eighth notes = 2 quarter notes.

- **Measure 2:**
  - The measure contains:
    - One quarter note (D♭5) = 1 beat.
    - Two beamed eighth notes (A♭4, A♭4) = 1 beat.
  - Total rhythmic value = 1 quarter note + 2 eighth notes = 2 quarter notes.

- **Measure 3:**
  - The measure contains:
    - A dotted eighth note (A♭4) = 0.75 beats.
    - A sixteenth note (A♭4) = 0.25 beats.
    - Four sixteenth notes (E♭5, D♭5, C5, B♭4) = 1 beat.
  - Total rhythmic value = 0.75 + 0.25 + 1 = 2 quarter notes.

- **Measure 4:**
  - The measure contains one quarter note (A♭4).
  - Total rhythmic value = 1 quarter note.

#### Step 2: Check the Total Value of the Beam Groupings
- The rhythmic groupings in each measure suggest **simple time** (not compound), as the notes are grouped into eighths and quarters, not triplets or dotted groupings.

#### Step 3: Count the Total Beats in the Measure
- Each measure consistently adds up to **2 quarter notes**.

#### Step 4: Write the Time Signature
- The total beats per measure = 2.
- The note value of one beat = quarter note.
- Therefore, the time signature is **2/4**.

### Final Answer:
- **Key:** D♭ Major
- **Time Signature:** 2/4
