### Step 1: Determine the Interval of Transposition
The original key is **E major** (4 sharps: F♯, C♯, G♯, D♯). The target key is **A♭ major** (4 flats: B♭, E♭, A♭, D♭).

To find the interval of transposition:
- Count the letter names from E to A♭: E (1), F (2), G (3), A (4). This is a **fourth**.
- Determine the quality: In the E major scale (E, F♯, G♯, A, B, C♯, D♯), A is a Perfect fourth above E. However, A♭ is one semitone lower than A, making the interval a **diminished fourth**.

Thus, the interval of transposition is a **diminished fourth upward**.

### Step 2: Transpose the Key Signature
The original key signature of E major (4 sharps) is replaced with the key signature of A♭ major (4 flats).

### Step 3: Transpose Each Note
We will transpose each note in the melody up by a **diminished fourth**. This involves adjusting both the pitch and accidentals. The rhythm remains unchanged.

#### Measure 1:
1. **E4 (half note)** → Transpose up a diminished fourth:
   - E to A is a Perfect fourth. A♭ is one semitone lower.
   - Result: **A♭4 (half note)**.

2. **G♯4 (quarter note)** → Transpose up a diminished fourth:
   - G♯ to C is a Perfect fourth. C♭ is one semitone lower.
   - Result: **C♭5 (quarter note)**.

3. **B4 (quarter note)** → Transpose up a diminished fourth:
   - B to E is a Perfect fourth. E♭ is one semitone lower.
   - Result: **E♭5 (quarter note)**.

#### Measure 2:
1. **D♯4 (dotted quarter note)** → Transpose up a diminished fourth:
   - D♯ to G is a Perfect fourth. G♭ is one semitone lower.
   - Result: **G♭4 (dotted quarter note)**.

2. **E4 (16th note)** → Transpose up a diminished fourth:
   - E to A is a Perfect fourth. A♭ is one semitone lower.
   - Result: **A♭4 (16th note)**.

3. **F♯4 (16th note)** → Transpose up a diminished fourth:
   - F♯ to B is a Perfect fourth. B♭ is one semitone lower.
   - Result: **B♭4 (16th note)**.
