### Step 1: Determine the Key of the Piece
#### 1. Check the Key Signature
The key signature has **3 sharps**. According to the table provided, this corresponds to either **A Major** or **F♯ Minor**.

#### 2. Determine if the Key is Major or Minor
- Look for accidentals that indicate a raised seventh degree (leading tone) for F♯ Minor. In the melody, there is no E♯ (the raised seventh of F♯ Minor). 
- The melodic and harmonic content emphasizes A Major, with frequent use of F♯, C♯, and D, which are diatonic to A Major. 
- The piece ends on **F♯5**, which is part of the dominant chord (E Major) in A Major, further supporting A Major as the key.

**Key: A Major**

### Step 2: Determine the Time Signature
#### 1. Analyze the Rhythmic Groupings in Each Measure
- **Bar 1:**
  - Quarter note (1 beat) + eighth note (0.5 beats) + three eighth notes (0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 = 1.5 beats) = **3 beats total**.
- **Bar 2:**
  - Quarter note (1 beat) + eighth note (0.5 beats) + three eighth notes (0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 = 1.5 beats) = **3 beats total**.
- **Bar 3:**
  - Six eighth notes (0.5 × 6 = 3 beats total) = **3 beats total**.
- **Bar 4:**
  - Dotted half note (1.5 × 2 = 3 beats total) = **3 beats total**.

#### 2. Determine the Beat Grouping
- Each measure consistently adds up to **3 beats**.
- The smallest rhythmic unit is the **eighth note (0.5 beats)**, so the bottom number of the time signature is **8**.

**Time Signature: 3/8**

### Step 3: Determine the Root/Quality Chord Symbols for Each Bar
#### Bar 1:
- Notes: F♯5, C♯5, A4, B4, C♯5.
- Strong beats: F♯ (beat 1), A (beat 3).
- Chord tones: F♯, A, C♯ form an **F♯ minor triad** (F♯-A-C♯).
- Non-chord tones: B (passing tone).

**Chord: F♯ Minor (F♯m)**

#### Bar 2:
- Notes: D5, B4, F♯5, E5, D5.
- Strong beats: D (beat 1), F♯ (beat 3).
- Chord tones: D, F♯, B form a **B minor triad** (B-D-F♯).
- Non-chord tones: E (passing tone).

**Chord: B Minor (Bm)**

#### Bar 3:
- Notes: C♯5, D♯5, E♯5, G♯5, F♯5, E♯5.
- Strong beats: C♯ (beat 1), G♯ (beat 3).
- Chord tones: C♯, E♯, G♯ form a **C♯ major triad** (C♯-E♯-G♯).
- Non-chord tones: F♯ (passing tone).

**Chord: C♯ Major (C♯)**

#### Bar 4:
- Notes: F♯5 (dotted half note).
- Strong beat: F♯ (beat 1).
- Chord tones: F♯ is the root of an **F♯ minor triad** (F♯-A-C♯). No other notes are present, but the implied harmony is F♯ minor.

**Chord: F♯ Minor (F♯m)**

### Summary
- **Key:** A Major
- **Time Signature:** 3/8
- **Chord Symbols:**
  - Bar 1: **F♯m**
  - Bar 2: **Bm**
  - Bar 3: **C♯**
  - Bar 4: **F♯m**

This piece is in A Major and uses a 3/8 time signature. The harmonic progression emphasizes the minor vi (F♯m), ii (Bm), and V/vi (C♯) chords, creating a sense of movement and resolution back to F♯ minor.
