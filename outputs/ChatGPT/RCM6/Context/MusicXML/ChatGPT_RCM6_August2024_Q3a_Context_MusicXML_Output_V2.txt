In the bass clef, the ascending and descending **D-flat major scale** includes the following notes, using the key signature of 5 flats (B♭, E♭, A♭, D♭, G♭):

### Ascending:
D♭, E♭, F, G♭, A♭, B♭, C, D♭

### Descending:
D♭, C, B♭, A♭, G♭, F, E♭, D♭

The key signature should be written at the beginning of the staff, and no additional accidentals are needed since all flats are accounted for in the key signature.
