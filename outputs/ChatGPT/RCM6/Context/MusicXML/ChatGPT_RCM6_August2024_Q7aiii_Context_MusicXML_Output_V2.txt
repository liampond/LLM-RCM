### Step 1: Determine the Key of the Piece

#### 1. Check the Key Signature
The `<key>` element in the MusicXML file specifies `<fifths>1</fifths>`. This indicates one sharp in the key signature. Referring to the key signature table:
- One sharp corresponds to **G Major** or **E Minor**.

#### 2. Determine if the Key is Major or Minor
To distinguish between G Major and E Minor, we look for the raised seventh degree in E Minor (D♯). If present, this would indicate E Minor. Otherwise, the key is likely G Major.

- In Measure 2, there is a **D♯** (indicated by `<step>D</step><alter>1</alter>` with `<accidental>sharp</accidental>`). This is the raised seventh degree of E Minor.
- Additionally, the melodic content emphasizes E Minor characteristics, such as the use of B (the fifth of E Minor) and A (the fourth of E Minor).

Thus, the key of the piece is **E Minor**.

### Step 2: Determine the Time Signature

#### Step 1: Identify the Beat Groupings
We analyze the rhythmic groupings in each measure to infer the beat structure.

##### Measure 1:
- The measure contains six 16th notes grouped into one beam (G4, A4, B4, C5, A4) and a 16th rest at the beginning.
- Total rhythmic value:
  - 16th rest = 0.25 beats.
  - Five 16th notes = 5 × 0.25 = 1.25 beats.
  - Total = 1.5 beats.

##### Measure 2:
- The measure contains six 16th notes grouped into one beam (B4, G4, F♯4, E4, D♯4, A4).
- Total rhythmic value:
  - Six 16th notes = 6 × 0.25 = 1.5 beats.

##### Measure 3:
- The measure contains:
  - Two 32nd notes (G4, F♯4) = 2 × 0.125 = 0.25 beats.
  - One 16th note (E4) = 0.25 beats.
  - One eighth note (E5) = 0.5 beats.
  - One eighth rest = 0.5 beats.
- Total rhythmic value = 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.5 + 0.5 = 1.5 beats.

##### Measure 4:
- The measure contains:
  - Two 32nd notes (D♯5, C♯5) = 2 × 0.125 = 0.25 beats.
  - One 16th note (B4) = 0.25 beats.
  - One eighth note (A5) = 0.5 beats.
  - One eighth rest = 0.5 beats.
- Total rhythmic value = 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.5 + 0.5 = 1.5 beats.

#### Step 2: Check the Total Value of the Beam Groupings
- Each measure consistently adds up to **1.5 beats**.
- The rhythmic groupings suggest **compound time** because the total value of each beam grouping equals 0.75 beats (three 16th notes).

#### Step 3: Determine the Bottom Number
- The smallest rhythmic value is a 16th note (0.25 beats), so the bottom number of the time signature is **16**.

#### Step 4: Count the Total Beats in the Measure
- Each measure contains **1.5 beats**, grouped into three smaller beats (16th notes) per larger beat.
- The top number of the time signature is **3**.

#### Step 5: Write the Time Signature
- The time signature is **3/16**, indicating a compound meter with one beat per measure, each divided into three 16th notes.

### Summary
- **Key**: E Minor (one sharp in the key signature, presence of D♯ as the raised seventh degree).
- **Time Signature**: 3/16 (compound meter with one beat per measure, each divided into three 16th notes).
