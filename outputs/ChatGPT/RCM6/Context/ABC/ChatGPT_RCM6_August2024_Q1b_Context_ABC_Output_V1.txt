Let’s analyze the ABC file and determine the requested intervals step by step. The notes in the file are as follows:

1. **First note:** _B,,  
2. **Second note:** ^D,  
3. **Third note:** _G,,  
4. **Fourth note:** _C,  
5. **Fifth note:** E,,  

### 1. A Perfect 4th above the first note (_B,,)
- **Step 1:** Lower note is _B,, (B double flat).  
- **Step 2:** Count up to the 4th: B (1), C (2), D (3), E (4). The letter name is E.  
- **Step 3:** The B𝄫 major scale is: B𝄫, C♭, D♭, E𝄫, F♭, G♭, A♭. The 4th note is E𝄫, which is a Perfect 4th.  
- **Step 4:** No adjustment is needed for a Perfect 4th.  
- **Final Answer:** A Perfect 4th above _B,, is **E𝄫**.

### 2. A Major 3rd above the second note (^D,)
- **Step 1:** Lower note is ^D, (D sharp).  
- **Step 2:** Count up to the 3rd: D (1), E (2), F (3). The letter name is F.  
- **Step 3:** The D♯ major scale is: D♯, E♯, F♯, G♯, A♯, B♯, C♯. The 3rd note is F♯, which is a Major 3rd.  
- **Step 4:** No adjustment is needed for a Major 3rd.  
- **Final Answer:** A Major 3rd above ^D, is **F♯**.

### 3. A Diminished Octave above the third note (_G,,)
- **Step 1:** Lower note is _G,, (G double flat).  
- **Step 2:** Count up to the 8th: G (1), A (2), B (3), C (4), D (5), E (6), F (7), G (8). The letter name is G.  
- **Step 3:** The G𝄫 major scale is: G𝄫, A𝄫, B𝄫, C𝄫, D𝄫, E𝄫, F𝄫, G𝄫. The 8th note is G𝄫, which is a Perfect Octave.  
- **Step 4:** A Diminished Octave is one semitone lower than a Perfect Octave. Lower G𝄫 by one semitone → G𝄫𝄫.  
- **Final Answer:** A Diminished Octave above _G,, is **G𝄫𝄫**.

### 4. An Augmented 6th above the fourth note (_C,)
- **Step 1:** Lower note is _C, (C flat).  
- **Step 2:** Count up to the 6th: C (1), D (2), E (3), F (4), G (5), A (6). The letter name is A.  
- **Step 3:** The C♭ major scale is: C♭, D♭, E♭, F♭, G♭, A♭, B♭. The 6th note is A♭, which is a Major 6th.  
- **Step 4:** An Augmented 6th is one semitone higher than a Major 6th. Raise A♭ by one semitone → A.  
- **Final Answer:** An Augmented 6th above _C, is **A**.

---

### 5. A Minor 2nd above the fifth note (E,,)
- **Step 1:** Lower note is E,,.  
- **Step 2:** Count up to the 2nd: E (1), F (2). The letter name is F.  
- **Step 3:** The E major scale is: E, F♯, G♯, A, B, C♯, D♯. The 2nd note is F♯, which is a Major 2nd.  
- **Step 4:** A Minor 2nd is one semitone lower than a Major 2nd. Lower F♯ by one semitone → F.  
- **Final Answer:** A Minor 2nd above E,, is **F**.

### Final Results:
1. Perfect 4th above _B,, → **E𝄫**  
2. Major 3rd above ^D, → **F♯**  
3. Diminished Octave above _G,, → **G𝄫𝄫**  
4. Augmented 6th above _C, → **A**  
5. Minor 2nd above E,, → **F**
