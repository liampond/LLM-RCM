Here are the answers to the questions based on the provided ABC file and the guides:

1. **Key of the piece**:  
   The key signature has one flat (B♭), which corresponds to either F major or D minor. The piece emphasizes F as the tonic and does not show signs of a raised 7th (C♯) typical of D minor. Therefore, the key is **F major**.

2. **Time signature**:  
   The rhythmic groupings suggest compound time. Each measure contains three beats, with each beat subdivided into three eighth notes. This indicates a time signature of **9/8**.

3. **Chord outlined by the first three eighth notes of the second bar (in both hands)**:  
   The notes in the right hand are D, B♭, and D, while the left hand has F, B♭, and D. Together, these form the chord B♭-D-F, which is the subdominant triad (IV) in F major.  
   Answer: **Subdominant triad**.

4. **Interval between the last eighth note in the left hand of bar 2 and the first note in the left hand of bar 3**:  
   The last note in the left hand of bar 2 is G, and the first note in the left hand of bar 3 is E. Counting from G to E: G (1), A (2), B (3), C (4), D (5), E (6). This is a sixth.  
   In the key of F major, G to E is a **minor sixth**.  
   Answer: **Minor sixth**.

5. **Functional chord symbol for the chord outlined by the first three eighth notes of bar 5 (in both hands)**:  
   The notes in the right hand are F, A, and C, while the left hand has F, A, and C. Together, these form the chord F-A-C, which is the tonic triad (I) in F major.  
   Answer: **I (tonic)**.

6. **Chord outlined by the last three eighth notes of bar 7 (in both hands)**:  
   The notes in the right hand are C, F, and A, while the left hand has C, F, and A. Together, these form the chord F-A-C, which is the tonic triad (I) in F major.  
   Answer: **Tonic triad**.

7. **Interval between the second eighth note in the left hand of bar 8 and the third eighth note in the left hand of bar 8**:  
   The second note in the left hand of bar 8 is E, and the third note is B♭. Counting from E to B♭: E (1), F (2), G (3), A (4), B (5). This is a fifth.  
   In the key of F major, E to B♭ is a **diminished fifth**.  
   Answer: **Diminished fifth**.

8. **Rest at the end of bar 8 in the right hand**:  
   The right hand ends with an F, leaving the rest of the measure incomplete. Since the time signature is 9/8, the missing duration is one dotted quarter note (three eighth notes).  
   Answer: **Dotted quarter rest**.

9. **Parallel or contrasting period**:  
   The two phrases begin with similar melodic material, as seen in the repetition of the opening motif in the right hand. This indicates a **parallel period**.  
   Answer: **Parallel period**.

10. **Meaning of "allegretto vivace"**:  
    "Allegretto" indicates a moderately fast tempo, slightly slower than allegro. "Vivace" means lively or spirited. Together, "allegretto vivace" suggests a moderately fast and lively tempo.  
    Answer: **Moderately fast and lively**.
