### Step 1: Determine the Interval of Transposition
The original key is **E major**, and the target key is **A♭ major**. To find the interval:

1. Count the letter names from E to A:
   - E (1), F (2), G (3), A (4).
   - This is a **fourth**.

2. Determine the quality of the interval:
   - In the E major scale (E, F♯, G♯, A, B, C♯, D♯), A is the 4th note.
   - E to A is a **Perfect fourth**.

Thus, the interval of transposition is a **Perfect fourth upward**.

### Step 2: Transpose the Key Signature
The original key is **E major** (4 sharps: F♯, C♯, G♯, D♯). Transposing up a Perfect fourth leads to **A♭ major** (4 flats: B♭, E♭, A♭, D♭).

### Step 3: Transpose Each Note
We now transpose each note in the melody up a Perfect fourth. For each note, we calculate the interval and adjust accidentals as needed.

#### Measure 1: `E8 G4 B4`
1. **E → A♭** (Perfect fourth).
2. **G → C** (Perfect fourth).
3. **B → E♭** (Perfect fourth).

Result: `A♭8 C4 E♭4`

---

#### Measure 2: `D6 EF E4 z4`
1. **D → G** (Perfect fourth).
2. **E → A♭** (Perfect fourth).
3. **F → B♭** (Perfect fourth).
4. **E → A♭** (Perfect fourth).

Result: `G6 A♭B♭ A♭4 z4`

---

#### Measure 3: `c8 B4 e4`
1. **c → f** (Perfect fourth).
2. **B → E♭** (Perfect fourth).
3. **e → a♭** (Perfect fourth).

Result: `f8 E♭4 A♭4`

---

#### Measure 4: `B4 A2GA G4 z4`
1. **B → E♭** (Perfect fourth).
2. **A → D♭** (Perfect fourth).
3. **G → C** (Perfect fourth).
4. **A → D♭** (Perfect fourth).
5. **G → C** (Perfect fourth).

Result: `E♭4 D♭2CD♭ C4 z4`

### Step 4: Write the Transposed Melody in ABC Format
Here is the transposed melody in **A♭ major**:

```

### Final Answer
- The interval of transposition is a **Perfect fourth upward**.
- The melody has been transposed to **A♭ major** with the correct key signature and all notes adjusted accordingly.
