The **E-flat minor harmonic scale** in the **bass clef** uses a key signature of six flats (B♭, E♭, A♭, D♭, G♭, and C♭). The 7th degree is raised by a semitone (D♮) to create the harmonic form. Below are the notes in ascending and descending order:

### Ascending:
E♭, F, G♭, A♭, B♭, C♭, D♮, E♭

### Descending:
E♭, D♮, C♭, B♭, A♭, G♭, F, E♭

The key signature includes the six flats, and the D♮ is marked as an accidental.
