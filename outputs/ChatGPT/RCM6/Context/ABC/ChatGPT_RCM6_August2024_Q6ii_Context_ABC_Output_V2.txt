Let’s analyze the provided ABC file step by step using the guides.

### 1. **Key of the Melody**
- The key signature is `K:D`, which indicates **D major** or **B minor**.
- There are no accidentals in the melody that suggest a raised 7th (A#) for B minor.
- The melody and harmony emphasize D major chords (e.g., `[FAd]` in the last chord), confirming the key is **D major**.

**Key: D major**

### 2. **Root/Quality Chord Symbol of the Second Last Chord**
- The second last chord in `V:1` is `[EAc]`.
  - The notes are E, A, and C.
  - The bass note (root) is **E**.
  - From E:
    - A is a perfect 4th above E.
    - C is a minor 6th above E.
  - Rearrange the notes to form a triad: C, E, A → This is an **A minor triad in first inversion**.
  - The root is **A**, and the quality is **minor**.

**Root/Quality Chord Symbol: Am**

### 3. **Root/Quality Chord Symbol of the Last Chord**
- The last chord in `V:1` is `[FAd]`.
  - The notes are F#, A, and D.
  - The bass note (root) is **F#**.
  - From F#:
    - A is a minor 3rd above F#.
    - D is a minor 6th above F#.
  - Rearrange the notes to form a triad: D, F#, A → This is a **D major triad in first inversion**.
  - The root is **D**, and the quality is **major**.

**Root/Quality Chord Symbol: D**

### 4. **Functional Chord Symbol for the Second Last Chord**
- The second last chord is **Am**.
- In the key of D major:
  - A is the 5th scale degree.
  - An A minor chord is not diatonic to D major, but it can function as a **borrowed chord** (iv from D minor).

**Functional Chord Symbol: iv**

---

### 5. **Functional Chord Symbol for the Last Chord**
- The last chord is **D**.
- In the key of D major:
  - D is the 1st scale degree.
  - A D major chord is the tonic.

**Functional Chord Symbol: I**

---

### 6. **Type of Cadence**
- The second last chord is **iv** (A minor).
- The last chord is **I** (D major).
- A cadence that moves from a subdominant (iv) to the tonic (I) is an **authentic cadence**.

**Type of Cadence: Authentic**
