Let’s analyze the provided ABC file step by step using the guides.

### **Step 1: Determine the Key of the Melody**
- The key signature is `K:Eb`, which indicates **E♭ major** or its relative minor, **C minor**.
- To determine whether the piece is in E♭ major or C minor, we look for accidentals or harmonic/melodic clues:
  - The melody contains a `=B` (B♮) in the second measure, which is the raised 7th scale degree in C minor (B♮ is the leading tone in C minor).
  - This suggests the piece is in **C minor**.

**Key of the melody: C minor**

### **Step 2: Analyze the Second Last Chord**
- The second last chord is `[Gce]` in the treble clef and `C,` in the bass clef.
  - The notes in the chord are **C, E♭, and G**.
  - The bass note is **C**, so the root of the chord is **C**.
  - The interval between C and E♭ is a minor third (3 half steps), and the interval between C and G is a perfect fifth (7 half steps).
  - This makes the chord a **C minor triad**.

**Root/quality chord symbol of the second last chord: Cm**

### **Step 3: Analyze the Last Chord**
- The last chord is `[G=Bd]` in the treble clef and `G,,` in the bass clef.
  - The notes in the chord are **G, B♮, and D**.
  - The bass note is **G**, so the root of the chord is **G**.
  - The interval between G and B♮ is a major third (4 half steps), and the interval between G and D is a perfect fifth (7 half steps).
  - This makes the chord a **G major triad**.

**Root/quality chord symbol of the last chord: G**

### **Step 4: Determine the Functional Chord Symbols**
- The key is **C minor**.
- In C minor:
  - The second last chord, **C minor (Cm)**, is the tonic chord. Its functional symbol is **i**.
  - The last chord, **G major (G)**, is the dominant chord. Its functional symbol is **V**.

**Functional chord symbol for the second last chord: i**  
**Functional chord symbol for the last chord: V**

---

### **Step 5: Determine the Type of Cadence**
- The cadence moves from **i (C minor)** to **V (G major)**.
- A cadence that ends on the dominant (V) is a **half cadence**.

**Type of cadence: Half**

### **Final Answer**
- **Key of the melody:** C minor  
- **Root/quality chord symbol of the second last chord:** Cm  
- **Root/quality chord symbol of the last chord:** G  
- **Functional chord symbol for the second last chord:** i  
- **Functional chord symbol for the last chord:** V  
- **Type of cadence:** Half
