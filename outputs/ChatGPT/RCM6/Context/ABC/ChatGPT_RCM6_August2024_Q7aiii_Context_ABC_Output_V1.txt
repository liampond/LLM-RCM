### Step 1: Determine the Key

#### 1. Check the Key Signature
The key signature in the ABC file is `K:G`, which indicates either **G Major** or **E Minor** (1 sharp: F♯).

#### 2. Determine if the Key is Major or Minor
To decide between G Major and E Minor, we look for accidentals or melodic/harmonic clues:
- The second measure contains `^D` (D♯), which is the raised seventh degree in E Minor (D♯ is the leading tone resolving to E).
- This suggests the piece is in **E Minor**, as the raised seventh is a hallmark of minor keys.

#### 3. Look for Other Clues
- The melodic content (e.g., `GABcA | BGFE^DA`) emphasizes E Minor, with the raised D♯ confirming the minor tonality.
- There is no strong evidence of G Major (e.g., no consistent emphasis on G or its major triad).

**Key: E Minor**

### Step 2: Determine the Time Signature

#### 1. Identify the Beat Groupings
The rhythm in the ABC file is as follows:
- Measure 1: `z GABcA`
  - Rest (`z`) = 1/16
  - GABcA = 5 sixteenth notes = 5/16
  - Total = 1/16 + 5/16 = **6/16**
- Measure 2: `BGFE^DA`
  - BGFE^DA = 6 sixteenth notes = **6/16**
- Measure 3: `G/F/Ee2 z2`
  - G/F/E = 3 sixteenth notes = 3/16
  - `e2` = 2 eighth notes = 4/16
  - `z2` = 2 eighth notes = 4/16
  - Total = 3/16 + 4/16 + 4/16 = **11/16**
- Measure 4: `^d/^c/Ba2 z2`
  - `^d/^c/B` = 3 sixteenth notes = 3/16
  - `a2` = 2 eighth notes = 4/16
  - `z2` = 2 eighth notes = 4/16
  - Total = 3/16 + 4/16 + 4/16 = **11/16**

#### 2. Check for Consistency
- Measures 1 and 2 are **6/16**.
- Measures 3 and 4 are **11/16**.
- The time signature alternates between **6/16** and **11/16**, suggesting an irregular meter.

#### 3. Write the Time Signature
Since the time signature alternates, it is best described as **6/16 + 11/16**, indicating a compound irregular meter.

### Final Answer:
- **Key:** E Minor
- **Time Signature:** 6/16 + 11/16 (irregular meter)
