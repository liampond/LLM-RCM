Let’s analyze the intervals between the notes in each measure of the provided ABC file. The file specifies pairs of notes in brackets (e.g., `[Ag]`), and we will determine the interval between the two notes in each measure.

### Measure 1: `[Ag]`
- **Step 1: Identify the Notes**  
  The notes are A (lower note) and G (higher note).

- **Step 2: Determine the Interval Number**  
  Count the letter names: A (1), B (2), C (3), D (4), E (5), F (6), G (7).  
  The interval is a seventh.

- **Step 3: Determine the Quality of the Interval**  
  The A major scale is: A, B, C♯, D, E, F♯, G♯.  
  In this scale, G♯ is the 7th note. G (natural) is one semitone lower than G♯.  
  Lowering a Major seventh by one semitone makes it a **Minor seventh**.

- **Final Answer for Measure 1**: Minor seventh.

### Measure 2: `[F_B]`
- **Step 1: Identify the Notes**  
  The notes are F (lower note) and B (higher note).

- **Step 2: Determine the Interval Number**  
  Count the letter names: F (1), G (2), A (3), B (4).  
  The interval is a fourth.

- **Step 3: Determine the Quality of the Interval**  
  The F major scale is: F, G, A, B♭, C, D, E.  
  In this scale, B♭ is the 4th note. B (natural) is one semitone higher than B♭.  
  Raising a Perfect fourth by one semitone makes it an **Augmented fourth**.

- **Final Answer for Measure 2**: Augmented fourth.

### Measure 3: `[Ec]`
- **Step 1: Identify the Notes**  
  The notes are E (lower note) and C (higher note).

- **Step 2: Determine the Interval Number**  
  Count the letter names: E (1), F (2), G (3), A (4), B (5), C (6).  
  The interval is a sixth.

- **Step 3: Determine the Quality of the Interval**  
  The E major scale is: E, F♯, G♯, A, B, C♯, D♯.  
  In this scale, C♯ is the 6th note. C (natural) is one semitone lower than C♯.  
  Lowering a Major sixth by one semitone makes it a **Minor sixth**.

- **Final Answer for Measure 3**: Minor sixth.

### Measure 4: `[_cd]`
- **Step 1: Identify the Notes**  
  The notes are C♭ (lower note) and D (higher note).

- **Step 2: Determine the Interval Number**  
  Count the letter names: C (1), D (2).  
  The interval is a second.

- **Step 3: Determine the Quality of the Interval**  
  The C♭ major scale is: C♭, D♭, E♭, F♭, G♭, A♭, B♭.  
  In this scale, D♭ is the 2nd note. D (natural) is two semitones higher than D♭.  
  Raising a Minor second by one semitone makes it a **Major second**.

- **Final Answer for Measure 4**: Major second.

### Measure 5: `[Bf]`
- **Step 1: Identify the Notes**  
  The notes are B (lower note) and F (higher note).

- **Step 2: Determine the Interval Number**  
  Count the letter names: B (1), C (2), D (3), E (4), F (5).  
  The interval is a fifth.

- **Step 3: Determine the Quality of the Interval**  
  The B major scale is: B, C♯, D♯, E, F♯, G♯, A♯.  
  In this scale, F♯ is the 5th note. F (natural) is one semitone lower than F♯.  
  Lowering a Perfect fifth by one semitone makes it a **Diminished fifth**.

- **Final Answer for Measure 5**: Diminished fifth.
