### Step 1: Determine the Key

#### 1. Check the Key Signature
The key signature in the ABC file is `K:G`, which indicates either **G Major** or **E Minor** (1 sharp: F♯).

#### 2. Determine if the Key is Major or Minor
- Look for accidentals that suggest a raised seventh degree, which would indicate a minor key.
- In the provided music, there is a `^D` (D♯) in the second measure. D♯ is the raised seventh degree in E Minor (E-F♯-G-A-B-C-D♯-E).
- This suggests the piece is in **E Minor**.

#### 3. Look for Other Clues
- The melodic content includes descending motion (BGFE) and the raised seventh (D♯), which are characteristic of E Minor.
- There is no strong evidence to suggest G Major, as the raised seventh (D♯) points clearly to E Minor.

**Key: E Minor**

### Step 2: Determine the Time Signature

#### 1. Identify the Beat Groupings
The rhythm in the ABC file is as follows:
- Measure 1: `z GABcA`
  - Rest (`z`) = 1/16
  - GABcA = 1/16 + 1/16 + 1/16 + 1/16 + 1/16 = 5/16
  - Total = 1/16 (rest) + 5/16 = **6/16**.

- Measure 2: `BGFE^DA`
  - B = 1/16
  - G = 1/16
  - F = 1/16
  - E = 1/16
  - ^D = 1/16
  - A = 1/16
  - Total = **6/16**.

- Measure 3: `G/F/Ee2 z2`
  - G/F/E = 1/16 + 1/16 + 1/16 = 3/16
  - `e2` = 2/16
  - `z2` = 2/16
  - Total = 3/16 + 2/16 + 2/16 = **7/16**.

- Measure 4: `^d/^c/Ba2 z2`
  - ^d = 1/16
  - ^c = 1/16
  - B = 1/16
  - `a2` = 2/16
  - `z2` = 2/16
  - Total = 1/16 + 1/16 + 1/16 + 2/16 + 2/16 = **7/16**.

#### 2. Check the Total Value of the Beam Groupings
- The rhythmic groupings suggest **compound time** because the measures are grouped into values divisible by 3 (e.g., 6/16, 7/16).
- The smallest rhythmic value is a sixteenth note, so the bottom number of the time signature is **16**.

#### 3. Count the Total Beats in the Measure
- Measures 1 and 2 have 6/16 each, suggesting **6/16** time.
- Measures 3 and 4 have 7/16 each, suggesting **7/16** time.

#### 4. Write the Time Signature
- The piece alternates between **6/16** and **7/16**, indicating **irregular meter**.

### Summary

- **Key**: E Minor (1 sharp, with a raised seventh degree D♯).
- **Time Signature**: The piece alternates between **6/16** and **7/16**, indicating an irregular meter.
