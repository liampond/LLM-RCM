### Step 1: Determine the Key

#### 1. Check the Key Signature
The key signature in the ABC file is `K:Db`. This indicates 5 flats (B♭, E♭, A♭, D♭, G♭). Referring to the table provided:
- 5 flats correspond to **D♭ Major** or **B♭ Minor**.

#### 2. Determine if the Key is Major or Minor
To decide between D♭ Major and B♭ Minor, we look for clues in the melody:
- In B♭ Minor, the raised seventh degree (A♮) would typically appear as an accidental to create a leading tone.
- The melody contains no A♮ or other accidentals that suggest a minor key. Instead, the notes (D♭, F, A♭, etc.) align with D♭ Major.

Thus, the key is **D♭ Major**.

### Step 2: Determine the Time Signature

#### 1. Analyze the Rhythmic Values
The rhythm in the ABC file is as follows:
- Measure 1: `dd ff`
  - Each `d` and `f` is an eighth note (1/8 each).
  - Total = 1/8 + 1/8 + 1/8 + 1/8 = **4/8**.
- Measure 2: `d2 AA`
  - `d2` is a quarter note (2/8), and each `A` is an eighth note (1/8 each).
  - Total = 2/8 + 1/8 + 1/8 = **4/8**.
- Measure 3: `A>A e/d/c/B/`
  - `A>A` is a dotted eighth note (3/16) followed by a sixteenth note (1/16), totaling 4/16 = 2/8.
  - `e/d/c/B/` are four sixteenth notes (1/16 each), totaling 4/16 = 2/8.
  - Total = 2/8 + 2/8 = **4/8**.

Each measure consistently adds up to **4/8**.

#### 2. Determine the Beat Groupings
- The notes are grouped in pairs of eighth notes, suggesting **simple time**.
- Each beat is an eighth note, so the bottom number of the time signature is **8**.

#### 3. Count the Total Beats in Each Measure
- Each measure contains 4 eighth notes, so the top number of the time signature is **4**.

#### 4. Write the Time Signature
The time signature is **4/8**.

### Summary
- **Key**: D♭ Major
- **Time Signature**: 4/8
