### Step 1: Determine the Key

#### 1. Check the Key Signature
The key signature in the ABC file is `K:G`, which indicates either **G Major** or **E Minor** (1 sharp: F♯).

#### 2. Determine if the Key is Major or Minor
- The notes in the file are: `g`, `b`, `f`, `d`, `e`, `c`, `G`, and `B`.
- The presence of `f` (natural) instead of `F♯` suggests that the piece is not in G Major, as G Major requires F♯.
- The notes `g`, `b`, and `d` form a G minor triad, and the note `f` (natural) is the minor seventh of G, which is consistent with the **E Minor** scale.
- However, the lack of a raised seventh (D♯) in the melody suggests the piece is not in E Minor either.

Given the ambiguity, the key is likely **modal**, centered around G but without a clear major or minor tonality. It could be **G Dorian** or **G Mixolydian**, depending on harmonic context.

### Step 2: Determine the Time Signature

#### 1. Identify the Beat Groupings
The rhythm in the file is as follows:
- Measure 1: `gbf gbd gbf gbd`
  - Each group (`gbf` or `gbd`) consists of three sixteenth notes (0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 = 0.75 beats).
  - There are 4 such groupings in the measure, totaling 4 × 0.75 = **3 beats**.
- Measure 2: `ecG g2c dBG g2`
  - `ecG` consists of three sixteenth notes (0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 = 0.75 beats).
  - `g2c` consists of a dotted eighth note (1.5 beats).
  - `dBG` consists of three sixteenth notes (0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 = 0.75 beats).
  - `g2` consists of a dotted eighth note (1.5 beats).
  - Total: 0.75 + 1.5 + 0.75 + 1.5 = **4.5 beats**.

#### 2. Check the Total Value of the Beam Groupings
- Measure 1 totals **3 beats**.
- Measure 2 totals **4.5 beats**.
This inconsistency suggests that the time signature is irregular or changes between measures.

#### 3. Determine the Bottom Number
- The smallest rhythmic value is a sixteenth note (0.25 beats).
- The bottom number of the time signature is therefore **16**.

#### 4. Count the Total Beats in Each Measure
- Measure 1: 3 beats × 4 sixteenth notes per beat = **12/16**.
- Measure 2: 4.5 beats × 4 sixteenth notes per beat = **18/16**.

### Final Answer

- **Key**: Modal, likely **G Dorian** or **G Mixolydian**.
- **Time Signature**: The piece alternates between **12/16** and **18/16**.
