### Step 1: Determine the Key of the Piece
#### 1. Check the Key Signature
The key signature is **A major** (three sharps: F♯, C♯, G♯). This suggests the key could be **A major** or its relative minor, **F♯ minor**.

#### 2. Determine if the Key is Major or Minor
- The melody contains the note **C♯** (the major third of A major) and **G♯** (the leading tone of A major). These notes strongly suggest **A major**.
- There is no evidence of a raised seventh (E♯) or other accidentals that would indicate **F♯ minor**.

**Key: A major**

### Step 2: Determine the Time Signature
#### Analyze the Rhythms in Each Bar
The piece uses **1/8 as the base unit** (L:1/8). Let’s analyze the rhythmic values in each bar:

- **Bar 1:** `f2 c ABc`
  - `f2` = 2 eighth notes.
  - `c` = 1 eighth note.
  - `ABc` = 3 eighth notes.
  - Total = **6 eighth notes**.

- **Bar 2:** `d2 B fed`
  - `d2` = 2 eighth notes.
  - `B` = 1 eighth note.
  - `fed` = 3 eighth notes.
  - Total = **6 eighth notes**.

- **Bar 3:** `c^d^e gfe`
  - `c^d^e` = 3 eighth notes.
  - `gfe` = 3 eighth notes.
  - Total = **6 eighth notes**.

- **Bar 4:** `f6`
  - `f6` = 6 eighth notes.
  - Total = **6 eighth notes**.

#### Determine the Beat Grouping
- Each bar contains **6 eighth notes**, grouped into two sets of three eighth notes.
- This grouping suggests **compound duple meter**.

**Time Signature: 6/8**

### Step 3: Determine the Root/Quality Chord Symbols for Each Bar
#### Bar 1: `f2 c ABc`
- **Notes:** F, C, A, B, C.
- **Strong Beats:** F (beat 1), A (beat 4).
- **Chord Tones:** F, A, C form an **F major triad** (F–A–C).
- **Non-Chord Tones:** B and the second C are passing tones.

**Chord: F major (F)**

---

#### Bar 2: `d2 B fed`
- **Notes:** D, B, F, E, D.
- **Strong Beats:** D (beat 1), F (beat 4).
- **Chord Tones:** D, F, B form a **B diminished triad** (B–D–F).
- **Non-Chord Tones:** E is a passing tone.

**Chord: B diminished (B°)**

---

#### Bar 3: `c^d^e gfe`
- **Notes:** C, D♯, E, G, F, E.
- **Strong Beats:** C (beat 1), G (beat 4).
- **Chord Tones:** C, E, G form a **C major triad** (C–E–G).
- **Non-Chord Tones:** D♯ is a chromatic passing tone, and F is a neighbor tone.

**Chord: C major (C)**

---

#### Bar 4: `f6`
- **Notes:** F (repeated six times).
- **Strong Beats:** F (all beats).
- **Chord Tones:** F is the root of an **F major triad** (F–A–C), though only the root is present.

**Chord: F major (F)**

---

### Final Answer
- **Key:** A major
- **Time Signature:** 6/8
- **Bar 1 Chord:** F major (F)
- **Bar 2 Chord:** B diminished (B°)
- **Bar 3 Chord:** C major (C)
- **Bar 4 Chord:** F major (F)
