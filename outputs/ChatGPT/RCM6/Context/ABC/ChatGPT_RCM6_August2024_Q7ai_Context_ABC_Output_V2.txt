### Step 1: Determine the Key

#### 1. Check the Key Signature
The key signature in the ABC file is `K:G`, which indicates either **G Major** or **E Minor** (1 sharp: F♯).

#### 2. Determine if the Key is Major or Minor
- The notes in the file are: `g`, `b`, `f`, `d`, `e`, `c`, `G`, and `B`.
- The presence of `F♯` (as part of the `gbf` grouping) aligns with the key signature of G Major or E Minor.
- There is no raised seventh (D♯) in the melody, which would indicate E Minor. Instead, the melodic content emphasizes G, B, and D, which form the tonic triad of **G Major**.
- The piece starts with `g` and ends with `g2`, further reinforcing G Major as the tonic.

**Key: G Major**

### Step 2: Determine the Time Signature

#### 1. Identify the Beat Groupings
The rhythm is encoded as follows:
- Measure 1: `gbf gbd gbf gbd`
- Measure 2: `ecG g2c dBG g2`

Each note is a sixteenth note (`1/16`), as indicated by `L:1/16`. The notes are grouped into sets of three (e.g., `gbf`, `gbd`), suggesting compound time.

#### 2. Check the Total Value of the Beam Groupings
- Each grouping (`gbf`, `gbd`, etc.) contains three sixteenth notes:
  - 3 × 1/16 = 3/16 per grouping.
- There are four groupings per measure:
  - 4 × 3/16 = 12/16 per measure.

#### 3. Determine the Bottom Number
- The smallest rhythmic value is a sixteenth note (`1/16`), so the bottom number of the time signature is **16**.

#### 4. Count the Total Beats in the Measure
- Each grouping represents one beat in compound time (3 sixteenth notes per beat).
- There are four groupings per measure, so there are **4 beats per measure**.

#### 5. Write the Time Signature
- The time signature is **12/16**, indicating compound quadruple time (4 beats per measure, each beat divided into 3 sixteenth notes).

**Time Signature: 12/16**

### Summary
- **Key:** G Major
- **Time Signature:** 12/16
