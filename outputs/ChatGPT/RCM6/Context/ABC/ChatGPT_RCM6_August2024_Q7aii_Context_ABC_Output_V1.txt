### Step 1: Determine the Key

#### 1. Check the Key Signature
The key signature is `K:Db`, which indicates **D♭ Major** or its relative minor, **B♭ Minor** (5 flats: B♭, E♭, A♭, D♭, G♭).

#### 2. Determine if the Key is Major or Minor
- The notes in the melody include `d`, `f`, and `A`. These notes align with the tonic triad of **D♭ Major** (D♭-F-A♭), suggesting a major key.
- There are no accidentals indicating a raised seventh (C♮) that would suggest **B♭ Minor**.

#### 3. Look for Other Clues
- The melody begins and ends on `A`, which could imply **D♭ Major** (A♭ is the dominant note in D♭ Major).
- The harmonic and melodic content does not strongly suggest a minor key.

**Conclusion for Key:** The piece is in **D♭ Major**.

### Step 2: Determine the Time Signature

#### 1. Identify the Beat Groupings
The rhythm is as follows:
- Measure 1: `dd` (two eighth notes), `ff` (two eighth notes).
- Measure 2: `d2` (a quarter note), `AA` (two eighth notes).
- Measure 3: `A>A` (a dotted eighth note and a sixteenth note), `e/d/c/B/` (four sixteenth notes).
- Measure 4: `A2` (a half note).

#### 2. Analyze the Rhythmic Values
- Measure 1: `dd ff` = 1/8 + 1/8 + 1/8 + 1/8 = 4/8 (or 2/4).
- Measure 2: `d2 AA` = 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/8 = 4/8 (or 2/4).
- Measure 3: `A>A e/d/c/B/` = 3/16 (dotted eighth) + 1/16 (sixteenth) + 1/16 + 1/16 + 1/16 + 1/16 = 8/16 = 4/8 (or 2/4).
- Measure 4: `A2` = 1/2 = 4/8 (or 2/4).

#### 3. Determine the Beat Grouping and Bottom Number
- The rhythm is consistently grouped into two beats per measure, with each beat represented by a quarter note (1/4).
- This indicates **simple duple time**.

#### 4. Write the Time Signature
- The total beats per measure are 2, and the beat unit is a quarter note.
- The time signature is **2/4**.

### Final Answer:
- **Key:** D♭ Major
- **Time Signature:** 2/4
