Let’s analyze the provided ABC file step by step using the guides.

### 1. **Key of the Melody**
- The key signature is `K:Eb`, which indicates **E♭ major** or its relative minor, **C minor**.
- To determine whether the piece is in E♭ major or C minor, we look for accidentals or harmonic/melodic clues.
  - The melody contains a `=B` (B♮) in the second measure, which is the raised 7th degree in C minor (B♮ is the leading tone in C minor).
  - This suggests the piece is in **C minor**.

**Key:** C minor

### 2. **Root/Quality Chord Symbol of the Second Last Chord**
- The second last chord in the melody (V:1) is `[Gce]`.
  - The notes are G, C, and E♭.
  - The bass note (lowest note) is G, so the root is **G**.
  - To determine the quality:
    - G → C is a perfect fourth, and G → E♭ is a minor sixth.
    - Rearranging the notes (C, E♭, G), this forms a **C minor triad** in first inversion (C is the root, E♭ is the minor third, and G is the perfect fifth).
  - The chord is **Cm/G** (C minor triad with G in the bass).

**Root/Quality Chord Symbol:** Cm/G

### 3. **Root/Quality Chord Symbol of the Last Chord**
- The last chord in the melody (V:1) is `[G=Bd]`.
  - The notes are G, B♮, and D.
  - The bass note (lowest note) is G, so the root is **G**.
  - To determine the quality:
    - G → B♮ is a major third, and G → D is a perfect fifth.
    - This forms a **G major triad**.
  - The chord is **G** (G major).

**Root/Quality Chord Symbol:** G

### 4. **Functional Chord Symbol for the Second Last Chord**
- The second last chord is **Cm/G**.
- In the key of C minor:
  - The root of the chord is C, which is the tonic (1st scale degree).
  - The chord is a minor triad, so it is **i**.
  - Since the chord is in first inversion (G in the bass), it is written as **i6**.

**Functional Chord Symbol:** i6

### 5. **Functional Chord Symbol for the Last Chord**
- The last chord is **G**.
- In the key of C minor:
  - The root of the chord is G, which is the dominant (5th scale degree).
  - The chord is a major triad, so it is **V**.

**Functional Chord Symbol:** V

### 6. **Type of Cadence**
- The second last chord is **i6** (tonic in first inversion).
- The last chord is **V** (dominant).
- A cadence ending on the dominant (V) is a **half cadence**.

**Type of Cadence:** Half
