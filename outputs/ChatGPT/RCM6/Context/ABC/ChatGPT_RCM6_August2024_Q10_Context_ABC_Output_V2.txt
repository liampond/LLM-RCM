### Answers:

1. **Key of the Piece**  
   Using **Guide 1**, the key signature has one flat (B♭). This corresponds to either F major or D minor. Examining the melodic and harmonic content, the piece emphasizes F as the tonic (e.g., the opening and closing notes in the right hand). Therefore, the key is **F major**.

2. **Time Signature**  
   Using **Guide 2**, the rhythmic groupings suggest compound time. Each measure contains three groups of three eighth notes (e.g., bar 1: f'2 c' a2 f | d'bd' c'3). This indicates **9/8** time, a compound triple meter.

3. **Chord Outlined by the First Three Eighth Notes of Bar 2 (Both Hands)**  
   In the right hand, the notes are **d', b, d'**, and in the left hand, the notes are **F, B, D**.  
   - In the key of F major, these notes form a **B diminished triad** (B-D-F), which is the supertonic triad (ii°).  
   **Answer: Supertonic triad.**

4. **Interval Between the Last Eighth Note in the Left Hand of Bar 2 and the First Note in the Left Hand of Bar 3**  
   The last eighth note in the left hand of bar 2 is **G**, and the first note in the left hand of bar 3 is **C**.  
   - Counting the letter names: G (1), A (2), B (3), C (4). This is a **fourth**.  
   - In the key of F major, G to C is a **perfect fourth**.  
   **Answer: Perfect fourth.**

5. **Functional Chord Symbol for the First Three Eighth Notes of Bar 5 (Both Hands)**  
   In the right hand, the notes are **f', c', a**, and in the left hand, the notes are **F, A, C**.  
   - These notes form an **F major triad** (F-A-C), which is the tonic chord (I) in the key of F major.  
   **Answer: I (Tonic).**

6. **Chord Outlined by the Last Three Eighth Notes of Bar 7 (Both Hands)**  
   In the right hand, the notes are **c', f, a**, and in the left hand, the notes are **C, F, A**.  
   - These notes form an **F major triad** (F-A-C), which is the subdominant triad (IV) in the key of F major.  
   **Answer: Subdominant triad.**

7. **Interval Between the Second Eighth Note in the Left Hand of Bar 8 and the Third Eighth Note in the Left Hand of Bar 8**  
   The second eighth note in the left hand of bar 8 is **E**, and the third eighth note is **B♭**.  
   - Counting the letter names: E (1), F (2), G (3), A (4), B (5). This is a **fifth**.  
   - In the key of F major, E to B♭ is a **diminished fifth**.  
   **Answer: Diminished fifth.**

8. **Rest to Complete Bar 8 in the Right Hand**  
   The right hand ends with an **F** on the first beat of bar 8. In 9/8 time, there are three beats per measure, each subdivided into three eighth notes. The remaining duration is two beats (6 eighth notes).  
   **Answer: A dotted quarter rest.**

9. **Parallel or Contrasting Period**  
   Using **Guide 6**, the two phrases (bars 1–4 and bars 5–8) begin with the same melodic material in the right hand (f'2 c' a2 f). This indicates a **parallel period**.  
   **Answer: Parallel period.**

10. **Meaning of Allegretto Vivace**  
    - **Allegretto**: A moderately fast tempo, slightly slower than Allegro.  
    - **Vivace**: Lively and spirited.  
    **Answer: Moderately fast and lively.**

### Summary:
- The piece is in **F major** and written in **9/8** time.  
- The first three eighth notes of bar 2 outline a **supertonic triad**, while the last three eighth notes of bar 7 outline a **subdominant triad**.  
- The interval between the last eighth note of bar 2 and the first note of bar 3 is a **perfect fourth**, while the interval between the second and third eighth notes of bar 8 is a **diminished fifth**.  
- The functional chord symbol for the first three eighth notes of bar 5 is **I (tonic)**.  
- A **dotted quarter rest** completes bar 8 in the right hand.  
- The passage is a **parallel period**, and the tempo marking **Allegretto vivace** indicates a moderately fast and lively character.
