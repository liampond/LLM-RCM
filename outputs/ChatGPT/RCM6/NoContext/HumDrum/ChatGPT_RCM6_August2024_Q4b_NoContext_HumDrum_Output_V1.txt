To transpose the melody from E major (key signature: 4 sharps) to A-flat major (key signature: 4 flats), we need to transpose the melody up by a **minor third** (E to G# is a major third, so E to Aâ™­ is a minor third). Below is the transposed melody with the correct notes, rhythms, and key signature:

### Explanation of Transposition:
1. **Key Signature**: The original key of E major (F#, C#, G#, D#) is transposed to A-flat major (Bb, Eb, Ab, Db).
2. **Notes**:
   - Original `2e` becomes `2g`.
   - Original `4g#` becomes `4bb`.
   - Original `4b` becomes `4db`.
   - Original `4.d#` becomes `4.fb`.
   - Original `16eLL` becomes `16gLL`.
   - Original `16f#JJ` becomes `16abJJ`.
   - Original `4e` becomes `4g`.
   - Original `2cc#` becomes `2ee`.
   - Original `4b` becomes `4db`.
   - Original `4ee` becomes `4ff`.
   - Original `8aL` becomes `8cbL`.
   - Original `16g#L` becomes `16bbL`.
   - Original `16aJJ` becomes `16cbJJ`.
   - Original `4g#` becomes `4bb`.

### Interval of Transposition:
The interval of transposition is a **minor third upward**.
