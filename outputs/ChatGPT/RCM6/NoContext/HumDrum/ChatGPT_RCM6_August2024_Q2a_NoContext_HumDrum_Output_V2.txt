To replace the placeholder rhythms with appropriate rests, we need to ensure that each measure adheres to the specified time signature. Here's the analysis and solution for each measure:

---

### Measure 1: **4/2**
- Notes: `4.f`, `4f`, `16f`
- Total duration: Dotted quarter (6/16) + quarter (4/16) + sixteenth (1/16) = 11/16
- Required duration: 4/2 = 32/16
- Missing duration: 32/16 - 11/16 = 21/16
- Solution: Add a **dotted half rest (12/16)** and a **dotted quarter rest (9/16)**.

---

### Measure 2: **4/2**
- Notes: `12fL`, `12f`, `12fJ`, `4f`
- Total duration: Each twelfth note = 1/12 of a whole note. Convert to sixteenths:
  - 12fL = 4/16
  - 12f = 4/16
  - 12fJ = 4/16
  - 4f = 16/16
  - Total = 28/16
- Required duration: 4/2 = 32/16
- Missing duration: 32/16 - 28/16 = 4/16
- Solution: Add a **sixteenth rest (1/16)** and a **dotted eighth rest (3/16)**.

### Measure 3: **6/4**
- Notes: `16fKL`, `8.fJ`, `4f`, `4.f`
- Total duration: 
  - 16fKL = 1/16
  - 8.fJ = 12/16
  - 4f = 16/16
  - 4.f = 24/16
  - Total = 53/16
- Required duration: 6/4 = 96/16
- Missing duration: 96/16 - 53/16 = 43/16
- Solution: Add a **dotted whole rest (32/16)** and an **eighth rest (11/16)**.

---

### Measure 4: **6/4**
- Notes: `4f`, `8f`, `8fL`, `8fJ`, `4f`
- Total duration:
  - 4f = 16/16
  - 8f = 8/16
  - 8fL = 8/16
  - 8fJ = 8/16
  - 4f = 16/16
  - Total = 56/16
- Required duration: 6/4 = 96/16
- Missing duration: 96/16 - 56/16 = 40/16
- Solution: Add a **dotted whole rest (32/16)** and an **eighth rest (8/16)**.

---

### Measure 5: **9/8**
- Notes: `16fKL`, `8f`, `16fJk`, `4f`
- Total duration:
  - 16fKL = 1/16
  - 8f = 6/16
  - 16fJk = 1/16
  - 4f = 24/16
  - Total = 32/16
- Required duration: 9/8 = 54/16
- Missing duration: 54/16 - 32/16 = 22/16
- Solution: Add a **dotted quarter rest (12/16)** and a **quarter rest (10/16)**.

---

### Measure 6: **9/8**
- Notes: `16f`, `4f`, `8f`, `16fLL`, `16f`, `16f`, `16fJ`, `8fJ`
- Total duration:
  - 16f = 1/16
  - 4f = 24/16
  - 8f = 6/16
  - 16fLL = 1/16
  - 16f = 1/16
  - 16f = 1/16
  - 16fJ = 1/16
  - 8fJ = 6/16
  - Total = 41/16
- Required duration: 9/8 = 54/16
- Missing duration: 54/16 - 41/16 = 13/16
- Solution: Add a **dotted eighth rest (9/16)** and a **sixteenth rest (4/16)**.

---

### Measure 7: **3/4**
- Notes: `4f`
- Total duration: 4f = 16/16
- Required duration: 3/4 = 24/16
- Missing duration: 24/16 - 16/16 = 8/16
- Solution: Add a **quarter rest (8/16)**.

---

### Measure 8: **3/4**
- Notes: `16.f`, `4f`
- Total duration:
  - 16.f = 3/16
  - 4f = 16/16
  - Total = 19/16
- Required duration: 3/4 = 24/16
- Missing duration: 24/16 - 19/16 = 5/16
- Solution: Add a **dotted eighth rest (5/16)**.
