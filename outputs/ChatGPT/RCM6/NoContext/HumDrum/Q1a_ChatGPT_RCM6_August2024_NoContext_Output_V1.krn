To determine the intervals between the notes in each measure, we compare the pitch of the two notes in each measure. Here are the intervals:

1. Measure 1: **a to gg**  
   Interval: **Minor 7th (descending)**

2. Measure 2: **f# to b-X**  
   Interval: **Diminished 5th (ascending)**

3. Measure 3: **e to cc#**  
   Interval: **Major 6th (ascending)**

4. Measure 4: **cc-X to dd**  
   Interval: **Augmented 2nd (ascending)**

5. Measure 5: **b to ff#**  
   Interval: **Diminished 5th (ascending)**

These intervals are calculated based on the diatonic and chromatic distances between the notes.
