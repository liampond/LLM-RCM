To determine the time signature for each measure, we analyze the rhythmic values of the notes in each measure and sum their durations. In **kern, the rhythmic values are as follows:

- `4.` = dotted quarter note = 1.5 beats
- `8` = eighth note = 0.5 beats
- `16` = sixteenth note = 0.25 beats
- `32` = thirty-second note = 0.125 beats

### Measure 1 (`=1` to `=`):
- `4.f` = 1.5 beats
- `8f` = 0.5 beats
- `16fLL` = 0.25 beats
- `16fJ` = 0.25 beats
- `8fJ` = 0.5 beats
- `8fL` = 0.5 beats
- `8fJ` = 0.5 beats

**Total: 1.5 + 0.5 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 = 4 beats**

Measure 1 is in **4/4 time**.

### Measure 2 (`=` to `==`):
- `16fLL` = 0.25 beats
- `16f` = 0.25 beats
- `32fL` = 0.125 beats
- `32fJJJ` = 0.125 beats
- `16.fLL` = 0.375 beats
- `32fK` = 0.125 beats
- `16fJJ` = 0.25 beats
- `8fL` = 0.5 beats
- `16fJk` = 0.25 beats

**Total: 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.125 + 0.125 + 0.375 + 0.125 + 0.25 + 0.5 + 0.25 = 2.25 beats**

Measure 2 does not fit a standard time signature. It may be incomplete or irregular.

---

### Conclusion:
- Measure 1: **4/4 time**
- Measure 2: Irregular (2.25 beats)
