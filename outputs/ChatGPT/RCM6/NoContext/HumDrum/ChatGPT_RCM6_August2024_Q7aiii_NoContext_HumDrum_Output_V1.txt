### Key of the Melody:
The key signature indicates **one sharp (F#)**, and the melody includes a **D#** (raised 7th scale degree), which strongly suggests the key of **E minor**.

### Time Signature:
The melody's rhythms suggest a **compound duple meter (6/8)**. This is inferred from the grouping of note values:
- Each measure contains rhythmic groupings that sum to **6 eighth-note beats** (e.g., 16th notes, 32nd notes, and 8th notes combine to fill two dotted quarter-note beats per measure). 
Thus, the inferred time signature is **6/8**.
