To replace the placeholder rhythms (quarter notes with x-shaped noteheads) with appropriate rests, we must ensure that each measure adheres to the specified time signature. Here's the analysis and solution for each measure:

---

### Measure 1: **Time Signature: 4/2**
- Notes: `4.f`, `4f`, `16f`
- Total duration: Dotted half note (3 beats) + quarter note (1 beat) + sixteenth note (1/4 beat) = 4 1/4 beats.
- Correction: The measure exceeds the time signature by 1/4 beat. Remove the sixteenth note (`16f`) to balance the measure.

---

### Measure 2: **Time Signature: 4/2**
- Notes: `12fL`, `12f`, `12fJ`, `4f`
- Total duration: Each twelfth note = 1/3 beat. So, 12fL + 12f + 12fJ = 1 beat. Adding the quarter note (1 beat) gives 2 beats.
- Correction: Add a **half rest** (2 beats) to complete the measure.

---

### Measure 3: **Time Signature: 6/4**
- Notes: `16fKL`, `8.fJ`, `4f`, `4.f`
- Total duration: Sixteenth note (1/4 beat) + dotted eighth note (3/4 beat) + quarter note (1 beat) + dotted half note (3 beats) = 5 beats.
- Correction: Add a **quarter rest** (1 beat) to complete the measure.

---

### Measure 4: **Time Signature: 6/4**
- Notes: `4f`, `8f`, `8fL`, `8fJ`, `4f`
- Total duration: Quarter note (1 beat) + eighth note (1/2 beat) + eighth note (1/2 beat) + eighth note (1/2 beat) + quarter note (1 beat) = 3 1/2 beats.
- Correction: Add a **dotted half rest** (2 1/2 beats) to complete the measure.

---

### Measure 5: **Time Signature: 9/8**
- Notes: `16fKL`, `8f`, `16fJk`, `4f`
- Total duration: Sixteenth note (1/2 beat) + eighth note (1 beat) + sixteenth note (1/2 beat) + dotted quarter note (3 beats) = 5 beats.
- Correction: Add a **dotted quarter rest** (3 beats) and an **eighth rest** (1 beat) to complete the measure.

---

### Measure 6: **Time Signature: 9/8**
- Notes: `16f`, `4f`, `8f`, `16fLL`, `16f`, `16f`, `16fJ`, `8fJ`
- Total duration: Sixteenth note (1/2 beat) + dotted quarter note (3 beats) + eighth note (1 beat) + sixteenth note (1/2 beat) + sixteenth note (1/2 beat) + sixteenth note (1/2 beat) + sixteenth note (1/2 beat) + eighth note (1 beat) = 7 1/2 beats.
- Correction: Add a **dotted eighth rest** (1 1/2 beats) to complete the measure.

---

### Measure 7: **Time Signature: 3/4**
- Notes: `4f`
- Total duration: Quarter note (1 beat).
- Correction: Add a **half rest** (2 beats) to complete the measure.

---

### Measure 8: **Time Signature: 3/4**
- Notes: `16.f`, `4f`
- Total duration: Dotted sixteenth note (3/8 beat) + quarter note (1 beat) = 1 3/8 beats.
- Correction: Add a **dotted quarter rest** (1 1/2 beats) and a **sixteenth rest** (1/8 beat) to complete the measure.

### Final Adjustments:
- Ensure all corrections are notated with the appropriate rests in the HumDrum format.
