To transpose the melody up a **minor sixth**, we need to raise each note by that interval while maintaining the rhythmic values. The original key is **E major** (key signature: 4 sharps - F#, C#, G#, D#). Transposing up a minor sixth from E major results in the key of **C minor** (key signature: 3 flats - Bb, Eb, Ab).

Here is the transposed melody with the correct notes, rhythms, and the new key signature:

### Explanation of the Transposition:
1. **Key Signature**: The original key of E major (4 sharps) becomes C minor (3 flats).
2. **Notes**:
   - Original **E** becomes **G**.
   - Original **G#** becomes **Bb**.
   - Original **B** becomes **D**.
   - Original **D#** becomes **F**.
   - Original **F#** becomes **Ab**.
   - Original **C#** becomes **E**.
3. **Rhythms**: All rhythmic values remain unchanged.

### New Key:
The transposed melody is now in **C minor**.
