To answer these questions, I will analyze the notes in the file and calculate the requested intervals. The file is in **kern format, and the notes are as follows:

1. First note: `BB-X` (B double-flat)
2. Second note: `D#X` (D double-sharp)
3. Third note: `GG-X` (G double-flat)
4. Fourth note: `C-X` (C double-flat)
5. Fifth note: `EE` (E natural)

Now, let's calculate the intervals:

1. **A perfect 4th above the first note (`BB-X`):**
   - A perfect 4th above B double-flat is E double-flat (`E-X`).

2. **A major 3rd above the second note (`D#X`):**
   - A major 3rd above D double-sharp is F double-sharp (`F#X`).

3. **A diminished 8ve above the third note (`GG-X`):**
   - A diminished octave above G double-flat is G triple-flat (`GG-X` to `GGG-X`).

4. **An augmented 6th above the fourth note (`C-X`):**
   - An augmented 6th above C double-flat is A flat (`Ab`).

5. **A minor 2nd above the fifth note (`EE`):**
   - A minor 2nd above E natural is F natural (`F`).

### Final Answers:
1. Perfect 4th above `BB-X`: `E-X`  
2. Major 3rd above `D#X`: `F#X`  
3. Diminished 8ve above `GG-X`: `GGG-X`  
4. Augmented 6th above `C-X`: `Ab`  
5. Minor 2nd above `EE`: `F`
