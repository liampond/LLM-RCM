### Key of the Melody:
The key signature indicates **F# major** (six sharps), but the presence of accidentals like D# and C# suggests the melody is in the **relative minor key**, which is **D# minor**.

### Time Signature:
The rhythm of the melody suggests a **compound duple meter (6/8)**. This is inferred from the grouping of rhythms, particularly the frequent use of eighth notes and their subdivisions into sixteenth and thirty-second notes, which align with the feel of two beats per measure, each subdivided into three.
