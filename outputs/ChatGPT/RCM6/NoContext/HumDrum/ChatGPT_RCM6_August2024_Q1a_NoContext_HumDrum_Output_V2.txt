Let's analyze the intervals between the notes in each measure. The key signature is D major (F# and C#), and accidentals are applied as needed. Here's the breakdown:

### Measure 1:
- Notes: **a** (A) and **gg** (G)
- Interval: **minor 7th** (A to G is a 7th, and G is a whole step below A)

### Measure 2:
- Notes: **f#** (F#) and **b-X** (B double flat, enharmonically A)
- Interval: **diminished 5th** (F# to B double flat is a diminished 5th)

### Measure 3:
- Notes: **e** (E) and **cc#** (C#)
- Interval: **minor 6th** (E to C# is a 6th, and C# is a minor 6th below E)

### Measure 4:
- Notes: **cc-X** (C double flat, enharmonically B flat) and **dd** (D)
- Interval: **augmented 2nd** (C double flat to D is an augmented 2nd)

### Measure 5:
- Notes: **b** (B) and **ff#** (F#)
- Interval: **diminished 5th** (B to F# is a diminished 5th)

### Summary of Intervals:
1. Minor 7th
2. Diminished 5th
3. Minor 6th
4. Augmented 2nd
5. Diminished 5th
