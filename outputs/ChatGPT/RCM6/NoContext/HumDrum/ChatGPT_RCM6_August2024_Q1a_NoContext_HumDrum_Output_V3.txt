Let's analyze the intervals between the notes in each measure. The key signature is D major (F# and C# are sharp), and accidentals are applied as necessary. Here's the breakdown:

### Measure 1:
- Notes: **a** (A) and **gg** (G)
- Interval: **minor 7th** (A to G is a minor 7th)

### Measure 2:
- Notes: **f#** (F#) and **b-X** (B double flat, enharmonically A)
- Interval: **diminished 5th** (F# to B double flat)

### Measure 3:
- Notes: **e** (E) and **cc#** (C#)
- Interval: **minor 6th** (E to C# is a minor 6th)

### Measure 4:
- Notes: **cc-X** (C double flat, enharmonically B flat) and **dd** (D)
- Interval: **augmented 2nd** (C double flat to D)

### Measure 5:
- Notes: **b** (B) and **ff#** (F#)
- Interval: **diminished 5th** (B to F#)

### Summary of Intervals:
1. Minor 7th  
2. Diminished 5th  
3. Minor 6th  
4. Augmented 2nd  
5. Diminished 5th
