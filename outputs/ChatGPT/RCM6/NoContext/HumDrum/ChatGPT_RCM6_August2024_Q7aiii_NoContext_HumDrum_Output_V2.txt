### Key of the Melody:
The key signature indicates **one sharp (F#)**, and the melody includes a **D#** (raised 7th scale degree), which strongly suggests the key of **E minor**.

### Time Signature:
The melody's rhythms suggest a **compound duple meter (6/8)**. This is inferred from the grouping of rhythms:
- Each measure contains rhythmic values that sum to **6 eighth notes** (e.g., combinations of 16ths, 32nds, and 8ths).
- The rhythmic flow and phrasing align with the feel of 6/8 rather than a simple meter like 3/4.
