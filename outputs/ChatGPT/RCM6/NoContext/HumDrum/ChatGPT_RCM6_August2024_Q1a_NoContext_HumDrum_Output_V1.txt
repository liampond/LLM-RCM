To determine the intervals between the notes in each measure, we analyze the encoded pitches and calculate the intervals based on their diatonic and chromatic distances. The key signature is D major (*k[f#c#]), and accidentals are considered.

### Measure 1:
- Notes: **a** (A4) and **gg** (G3)
- Interval: **Major 9th** (diatonically 9 steps, chromatically 14 semitones)

### Measure 2:
- Notes: **f#** (F#4) and **b-X** (B♭3)
- Interval: **Diminished 7th** (diatonically 7 steps, chromatically 9 semitones)

### Measure 3:
- Notes: **e** (E4) and **cc#** (C#5)
- Interval: **Minor 6th** (diatonically 6 steps, chromatically 8 semitones)

### Measure 4:
- Notes: **cc-X** (C♭5) and **dd** (D5)
- Interval: **Augmented 2nd** (diatonically 2 steps, chromatically 3 semitones)

### Measure 5:
- Notes: **b** (B4) and **ff#** (F#5)
- Interval: **Perfect 5th** (diatonically 5 steps, chromatically 7 semitones)

### Summary of Intervals:
1. Major 9th
2. Diminished 7th
3. Minor 6th
4. Augmented 2nd
5. Perfect 5th
