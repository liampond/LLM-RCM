### Key of the Melody:
The key signature provided is **five flats (B♭, E♭, A♭, D♭, G♭)**, which corresponds to either **D♭ major** or **B♭ minor**. Based on the melodic content, the melody is in **B♭ minor** (the relative minor of D♭ major), as it prominently features the tonic note B♭ and the leading tone A♮ (raised 7th scale degree in minor).

### Time Signature:
The melody's rhythm suggests a **compound duple meter (6/8)**. This is inferred from the grouping of eighth notes and the presence of dotted rhythms, which align with the characteristic "two beats per measure, each subdivided into three" structure of 6/8 time.
