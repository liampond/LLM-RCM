To answer these questions, I will carefully analyze the notes and intervals based on the given HumDrum file. The file specifies the notes and accidentals, and I will calculate the requested intervals accordingly.

### Notes in the file:
1. **BB-X**: B double-flat
2. **D#X**: D double-sharp
3. **GG-X**: G double-flat
4. **C-X**: C double-flat
5. **EE**: E natural

### Intervals:
1. **A perfect 4th above the first note (BB-X)**:
   - A perfect 4th above B double-flat is **E double-flat (E-X)**.

2. **A major 3rd above the second note (D#X)**:
   - A major 3rd above D double-sharp is **F double-sharp (F#X)**.

3. **A diminished 8ve above the third note (GG-X)**:
   - A diminished octave above G double-flat is **G triple-flat (G-X-X)**.

4. **An augmented 6th above the fourth note (C-X)**:
   - An augmented 6th above C double-flat is **A flat (Ab)**.

5. **A minor 2nd above the fifth note (EE)**:
   - A minor 2nd above E natural is **F natural (F)**.

### Final Answers:
1. **E-X** (E double-flat)
2. **F#X** (F double-sharp)
3. **G-X-X** (G triple-flat)
4. **Ab** (A flat)
5. **F** (F natural)
