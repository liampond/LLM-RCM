To answer these questions, I will carefully analyze the notes and intervals based on the given HumDrum file. The file specifies the notes in **kern format, and the key signature is neutral (`*k[]`), meaning no sharps or flats are implied unless explicitly notated.

### Notes in the file:
1. `BB-X` (B double-flat)
2. `D#X` (D double-sharp)
3. `GG-X` (G double-flat)
4. `C-X` (C double-flat)
5. `EE` (E natural)

### Intervals:
1. **A perfect 4th above the first note (`BB-X`):**
   - A perfect 4th above B double-flat is E double-flat (`EE-X`).

2. **A major 3rd above the second note (`D#X`):**
   - A major 3rd above D double-sharp is F double-sharp (`FX`).

3. **A diminished 8ve above the third note (`GG-X`):**
   - A diminished octave above G double-flat is G triple-flat (`GGG-X`).

4. **An augmented 6th above the fourth note (`C-X`):**
   - An augmented 6th above C double-flat is A flat (`Ab`).

5. **A minor 2nd above the fifth note (`EE`):**
   - A minor 2nd above E natural is F natural (`F`).

### Final Answers:
- Perfect 4th above `BB-X`: `EE-X`
- Major 3rd above `D#X`: `FX`
- Diminished 8ve above `GG-X`: `GGG-X`
- Augmented 6th above `C-X`: `Ab`
- Minor 2nd above `EE`: `F`
