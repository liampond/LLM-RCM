To determine the time signature for each measure, we analyze the rhythmic values in each bar. Here's the breakdown:

### Measure 1:
- `4.f` = dotted quarter note (1.5 beats)
- `8f` = eighth note (0.5 beats)
- `16fLL` = sixteenth note (0.25 beats)
- `16fJ` = sixteenth note (0.25 beats)
- `8fJ` = eighth note (0.5 beats)
- `8fL` = eighth note (0.5 beats)
- `8fJ` = eighth note (0.5 beats)

Total: 1.5 + 0.5 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 = **4 beats**.

### Measure 2:
- `16fLL` = sixteenth note (0.25 beats)
- `16f` = sixteenth note (0.25 beats)
- `32fL` = thirty-second note (0.125 beats)
- `32fJJJ` = thirty-second note (0.125 beats)
- `16.fLL` = dotted sixteenth note (0.375 beats)
- `32fK` = thirty-second note (0.125 beats)
- `16fJJ` = sixteenth note (0.25 beats)
- `8fL` = eighth note (0.5 beats)
- `16fJk` = sixteenth note (0.25 beats)

Total: 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.125 + 0.125 + 0.375 + 0.125 + 0.25 + 0.5 + 0.25 = **2 beats**.

### Conclusion:
- Measure 1: **4/4 time signature**.
- Measure 2: **2/4 time signature**.
