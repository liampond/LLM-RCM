To transpose the melody up a **minor sixth**, we need to raise each note by that interval while maintaining the correct accidentals and rhythms. The original key is **E major** (key signature: 4 sharps - F#, C#, G#, D#). Transposing up a minor sixth from E major results in the key of **C minor** (key signature: 3 flats - Bb, Eb, Ab).

Here is the transposed melody:

### Explanation of the Transposition:
1. **Key Signature**: The original key of E major (4 sharps) becomes C minor (3 flats).
2. **Notes**:
   - E → G
   - G# → Bb
   - B → D
   - D# → F
   - F# → Ab
   - C# → E
3. **Rhythms**: The rhythms remain unchanged.
4. **New Key**: The transposed melody is now in **C minor**.
