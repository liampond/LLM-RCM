To transpose the melody from E major (key signature: 4 sharps) to A-flat major (key signature: 4 flats), we need to transpose every note up by a **minor 6th**. Below is the transposed melody with the correct key signature and notes:

### Explanation:
1. The interval of transposition is a **minor 6th** (e.g., E → G, G# → Bb, etc.).
2. The key signature changes from 4 sharps (E major) to 4 flats (A-flat major).
3. Each note and rhythm is transposed accordingly:
   - Original: `2e` → Transposed: `2g`
   - Original: `4g#` → Transposed: `4bb`
   - Original: `4b` → Transposed: `4d`
   - And so on for the rest of the melody.

The rhythms remain unchanged, as transposition affects only pitch.
