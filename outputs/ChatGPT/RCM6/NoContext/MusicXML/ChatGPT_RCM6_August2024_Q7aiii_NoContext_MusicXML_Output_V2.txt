### Key of the Melody:
The key signature indicates **one sharp**, which corresponds to either **G major** or **E minor**. Based on the melodic content, the melody strongly emphasizes **G** and **A** in the first measure, suggesting **G major** as the key.

### Time Signature:
To infer the time signature, we analyze the rhythmic structure:

1. **Measure 1**:
   - Contains a 16th rest followed by five 16th notes.
   - Total duration: \( 1/16 + 5 \times 1/16 = 6/16 \).

2. **Measure 2**:
   - Contains six 16th notes.
   - Total duration: \( 6 \times 1/16 = 6/16 \).

3. **Measure 3**:
   - Contains two 32nd notes (\( 2 \times 1/32 = 1/16 \)), two 16th notes (\( 2 \times 1/16 = 2/16 \)), one 8th note (\( 1/8 = 2/16 \)), and an 8th rest (\( 1/8 = 2/16 \)).
   - Total duration: \( 1/16 + 2/16 + 2/16 + 2/16 = 7/16 \).

4. **Measure 4**:
   - Contains two 32nd notes (\( 2 \times 1/32 = 1/16 \)), two 16th notes (\( 2 \times 1/16 = 2/16 \)), one 8th note (\( 1/8 = 2/16 \)), and an 8th rest (\( 1/8 = 2/16 \)).
   - Total duration: \( 1/16 + 2/16 + 2/16 + 2/16 = 7/16 \).

### Conclusion:
The rhythmic structure is inconsistent across measures, with durations of **6/16** in the first two measures and **7/16** in the last two measures. This suggests the melody is written in an **irregular meter** rather than a standard time signature. If forced to assign a time signature, **6/16** could be used for the first two measures, and **7/16** for the last two.
