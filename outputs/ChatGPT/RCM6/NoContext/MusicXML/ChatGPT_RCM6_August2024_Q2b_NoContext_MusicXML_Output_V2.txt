To determine the time signature for each measure, we analyze the total rhythmic duration of the notes in each measure. The durations are given in terms of divisions, where the `<divisions>` element specifies that 8 divisions equal a quarter note.

### Measure 1:
- **Dotted quarter note (F4):** 12 divisions (quarter note = 8, dotted adds half = 4, total = 12).
- **Eighth note (F4):** 4 divisions.
- **Two 16th notes (F4):** 2 divisions each, total = 4 divisions.
- **Eighth note (F4):** 4 divisions.
- **Two eighth notes (F4):** 4 divisions each, total = 8 divisions.

**Total duration:** 12 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 8 = 32 divisions.  
Since 8 divisions = 1 quarter note, 32 divisions = 4 quarter notes.  
**Inferred time signature:** **4/4**.

### Measure 2:
- **Two 16th notes (F4):** 2 divisions each, total = 4 divisions.
- **Two 32nd notes (F4):** 1 division each, total = 2 divisions.
- **Dotted 16th note (F4):** 3 divisions (16th = 2, dot adds half = 1, total = 3).
- **32nd note (F4):** 1 division.
- **16th note (F4):** 2 divisions.
- **Eighth note (F4):** 4 divisions.
- **16th note (F4):** 2 divisions.

**Total duration:** 4 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 = 18 divisions.  
Since 8 divisions = 1 quarter note, 18 divisions = 2.25 quarter notes.  
This does not fit a standard time signature, suggesting either an irregular meter or incomplete notation. However, if we assume a missing rest or continuation, the measure could imply **3/8** or **6/16**.

### Conclusion:
- **Measure 1:** 4/4.
- **Measure 2:** Likely **3/8** or **6/16**, but incomplete or irregular.
