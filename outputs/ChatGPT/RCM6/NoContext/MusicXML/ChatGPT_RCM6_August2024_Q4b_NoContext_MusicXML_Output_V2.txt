The original key of the melody is **E major** (4 sharps: F#, C#, G#, D#). To transpose it to **A-flat major** (4 flats: B♭, E♭, A♭, D♭), we need to transpose the melody **up a minor third** (E to G# is a major third, and G# to A♭ is an enharmonic minor third). Below is the transposed melody with the correct notes, rhythms, and accidentals:
