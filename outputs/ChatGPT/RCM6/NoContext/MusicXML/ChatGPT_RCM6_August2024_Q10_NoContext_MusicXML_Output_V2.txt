3. **Chord outlined by the first three eighth notes of bar 2 (both hands)**: The notes are **D (right hand), B♭, and F (left hand)**. These form a **B♭ major triad**, which is the **subdominant triad (IV)** in F major.

4. **Interval between the last eighth note in the left hand of bar 2 and the first note in the left hand of bar 3**: The notes are **F (left hand, bar 2)** and **E (left hand, bar 3)**. The interval is a **minor seventh**.

5. **Functional chord symbol for the first three eighth notes of bar 5 (both hands)**: The notes are **F (right hand), A, and C (left hand)**. These form an **F major triad**, which is the **tonic chord (I)** in F major.
