### Key of the Melody:
The key signature indicates **one sharp**, which corresponds to either **G major** or **E minor**. Based on the melodic content, particularly the frequent use of **G**, **B**, and **D** (the tonic triad of G major), the melody is in **G major**.

### Time Signature:
The time signature is hidden, so we must infer it from the rhythmic structure. The melody consists primarily of **16th notes** grouped into sets of **4 per beat**, with occasional **eighth notes**. Each measure contains **16 16th-note durations**, which equates to **4 beats per measure** if each beat is a quarter note.

Thus, the inferred time signature is **4/4** (common time).
