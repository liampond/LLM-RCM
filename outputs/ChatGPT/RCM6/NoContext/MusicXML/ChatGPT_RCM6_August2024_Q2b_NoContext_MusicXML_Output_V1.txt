The provided MusicXML file does not explicitly specify a time signature in the `<attributes>` section of the measures. However, we can deduce the time signature by analyzing the note durations in each measure.

### Measure 1:
- Notes and their durations:
  - Dotted quarter note (F4): 12 divisions
  - Eighth note (F4): 4 divisions
  - Two 16th notes (F4): 2 + 2 divisions
  - Eighth note (F4): 4 divisions
  - Two eighth notes (F4): 4 + 4 divisions
- Total duration: 12 + 4 + 2 + 2 + 4 + 4 + 4 = **32 divisions**.

Assuming the `<divisions>` value of 8 corresponds to a quarter note, 32 divisions equal 4 quarter notes. This suggests a **4/4 time signature** for Measure 1.

### Measure 2:
- Notes and their durations:
  - Two 16th notes (F4): 2 + 2 divisions
  - Two 32nd notes (F4): 1 + 1 divisions
  - Dotted 16th note (F4): 3 divisions
  - 32nd note (F4): 1 division
  - 16th note (F4): 2 divisions
  - Eighth note (F4): 4 divisions
  - 16th note (F4): 2 divisions
- Total duration: 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 = **18 divisions**.

This does not align with a standard time signature, as it is incomplete or irregular. However, if the measure is intended to be complete, it might suggest a **3/4 time signature** (24 divisions) with missing or implied rests.

### Conclusion:
- Measure 1: Likely **4/4**.
- Measure 2: Likely **3/4**, though it appears incomplete or irregular.
