To replace the quarter notes with x-shaped noteheads with appropriate rests, we need to ensure that the total duration of each measure matches the time signature. Here's the breakdown for each measure containing these placeholder rhythms:

---

### Measure 1 (Time Signature: 4/2)
- Placeholder rhythm: Quarter note (x-shaped notehead, duration = 24).
- Remaining duration in the measure: \( 4 \times 24 = 96 \) (total measure duration) - \( 36 + 24 + 6 = 66 \) (sum of other notes) = **30**.
- Replace the placeholder with a **dotted quarter rest** (duration = 30).

---

### Measure 2 (Time Signature: 4/2)
- Placeholder rhythm: Quarter note (x-shaped notehead, duration = 24).
- Remaining duration in the measure: \( 96 - (8 + 8 + 8) = 72 \).
- Replace the placeholder with a **half rest** (duration = 48) and a **quarter rest** (duration = 24).

---

### Measure 3 (Time Signature: 6/4)
- Placeholder rhythm: Quarter note (x-shaped notehead, duration = 24).
- Remaining duration in the measure: \( 6 \times 24 = 144 \) - \( 6 + 18 + 36 = 60 \) = **84**.
- Replace the placeholder with a **dotted half rest** (duration = 72) and a **16th rest** (duration = 12).

---

### Measure 4 (Time Signature: 6/4)
- Placeholder rhythm: Quarter note (x-shaped notehead, duration = 24).
- Remaining duration in the measure: \( 144 - (12 + 12 + 12 + 12) = 96 \).
- Replace the placeholder with a **dotted half rest** (duration = 72) and a **quarter rest** (duration = 24).

---

### Measure 5 (Time Signature: 9/8)
- Placeholder rhythm: Quarter note (x-shaped notehead, duration = 24).
- Remaining duration in the measure: \( 9 \times 12 = 108 \) - \( 6 + 12 + 6 = 24 \) = **84**.
- Replace the placeholder with a **dotted quarter rest** (duration = 36) and a **dotted eighth rest** (duration = 18).

---

### Measure 6 (Time Signature: 9/8)
- Placeholder rhythm: Quarter note (x-shaped notehead, duration = 24).
- Remaining duration in the measure: \( 108 - (6 + 12 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6) = 60 \).
- Replace the placeholder with a **dotted quarter rest** (duration = 36) and a **quarter rest** (duration = 24).

---

### Measure 7 (Time Signature: 3/4)
- Placeholder rhythm: Quarter note (x-shaped notehead, duration = 24).
- Remaining duration in the measure: \( 3 \times 24 = 72 \) - \( 24 = 48 \).
- Replace the placeholder with a **half rest** (duration = 48).

---

### Measure 8 (Time Signature: 3/4)
- Placeholder rhythm: Quarter note (x-shaped notehead, duration = 24).
- Remaining duration in the measure: \( 72 - 9 = 63 \).
- Replace the placeholder with a **dotted half rest** (duration = 63).

### Summary of Replacements:
1. Measure 1: Dotted quarter rest.
2. Measure 2: Half rest + quarter rest.
3. Measure 3: Dotted half rest + 16th rest.
4. Measure 4: Dotted half rest + quarter rest.
5. Measure 5: Dotted quarter rest + dotted eighth rest.
6. Measure 6: Dotted quarter rest + quarter rest.
7. Measure 7: Half rest.
8. Measure 8: Dotted half rest.
