Let's analyze each interval carefully:

1. **A perfect 4th above the first note (B♭2):**
   - A perfect 4th above B♭ is **E♭**.
   - The octave remains the same, so the note is **E♭3**.

2. **A major 3rd above the second note (D♯3):**
   - A major 3rd above D♯ is **F♯**.
   - The octave remains the same, so the note is **F♯3**.

3. **A diminished 8ve above the third note (G♭2):**
   - A diminished octave is one semitone smaller than a perfect octave.
   - A perfect octave above G♭2 is G♭3. Lowering it by a semitone gives **F♮3**.

4. **An augmented 6th above the fourth note (C♭3):**
   - An augmented 6th above C♭ is **A♯**.
   - The octave remains the same, so the note is **A♯3**.

5. **A minor 2nd above the fifth note (E2):**
   - A minor 2nd above E is **F**.
   - The octave remains the same, so the note is **F2**.

### Final Answers:
- Perfect 4th above B♭2: **E♭3**
- Major 3rd above D♯3: **F♯3**
- Diminished 8ve above G♭2: **F♮3**
- Augmented 6th above C♭3: **A♯3**
- Minor 2nd above E2: **F2**
