### Key of the Melody:
The key signature indicates **one sharp**, which corresponds to either **G major** or **E minor**. Based on the melodic content, the melody emphasizes **G**, **A**, **B**, and **C**, which strongly suggests **G major** as the key.

### Time Signature:
The time signature is hidden, so we must infer it from the rhythmic structure. 

1. **Measure 1**: Contains a 16th rest followed by five 16th notes. This totals **6 sixteenth notes** (or 3 eighth notes).
2. **Measure 2**: Contains six 16th notes. This also totals **3 eighth notes**.
3. **Measure 3**: Contains two 32nd notes, one 16th note, one 8th note, and an 8th rest. This totals **3 eighth notes**.
4. **Measure 4**: Contains two 32nd notes, one 16th note, one 8th note, and an 8th rest. This also totals **3 eighth notes**.

Each measure consistently adds up to **3 eighth notes**, suggesting the time signature is **3/8**. 

### Final Answer:
- **Key**: G major  
- **Time Signature**: 3/8
