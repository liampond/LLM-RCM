### Key of the Melody:
The key signature indicates **5 flats**, which corresponds to either **D-flat major** or **B-flat minor**. Since the melody prominently features **A-flat** and **D-flat**, and the melodic contour and accidentals suggest a minor tonality, the key is **B-flat minor**.

### Time Signature:
The time signature is hidden, so we must infer it from the rhythmic structure:

1. **Measure 1**: Contains 4 eighth notes (2 beamed pairs of eighth notes). This suggests a total of **2 beats** in the measure if each beat is a quarter note.
2. **Measure 2**: Contains 1 quarter note (1 beat) and 2 eighth notes (1 beat when combined). This also totals **2 beats**.
3. **Measure 3**: Contains a dotted eighth note (3/4 of a beat), a sixteenth note (1/4 of a beat), and 4 sixteenth notes (1 beat). This totals **2 beats**.
4. **Measure 4**: Contains 1 quarter note (2 eighth notes' worth), which fits the pattern of **2 beats**.

Thus, the melody is in **2/4 time**.
