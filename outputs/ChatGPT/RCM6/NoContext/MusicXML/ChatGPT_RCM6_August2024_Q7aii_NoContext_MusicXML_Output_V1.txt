### Key of the Melody:
The key signature indicates **5 flats**, which corresponds to either **D-flat major** or **B-flat minor**. Since the melody prominently features **A-flat** (A♭4 and A♭5) and **D-flat** (D♭5), it is consistent with the **B-flat minor** scale. Therefore, the melody is in **B-flat minor**.

### Time Signature of the Melody:
The time signature is hidden, so we must infer it from the rhythmic structure:

1. **Measure 1**: Contains 4 eighth notes (D♭5, D♭5, F5, F5).
2. **Measure 2**: Contains 1 quarter note (D♭5) and 2 eighth notes (A♭4, A♭4), totaling 4 eighth-note beats.
3. **Measure 3**: Contains a dotted eighth note (A♭4), a sixteenth note (A♭4), and 4 sixteenth notes (E♭5, D♭5, C5, B♭4), totaling 4 eighth-note beats.
4. **Measure 4**: Contains 1 quarter note (A♭4), equivalent to 2 eighth-note beats.

Each measure consistently adds up to **4 eighth-note beats**, which corresponds to a **2/4 time signature**.
