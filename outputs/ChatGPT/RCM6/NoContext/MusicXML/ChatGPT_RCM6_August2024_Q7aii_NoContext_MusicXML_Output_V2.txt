### Key of the Melody:
The key signature indicates **5 flats**, which corresponds to either **D-flat major** or **B-flat minor**. Since the melody prominently features **A-flat** (A♭4 and A♭5) and **D-flat** (D♭5), and the overall character suggests a minor tonality, the melody is in **B-flat minor**.

### Time Signature:
To infer the time signature, we analyze the rhythmic structure of the measures:

1. **Measure 1**: Contains four eighth notes (D♭5, D♭5, F5, F5), which total **2 beats**.
2. **Measure 2**: Contains one quarter note (D♭5) and two eighth notes (A♭4, A♭4), which also total **2 beats**.
3. **Measure 3**: Contains a dotted eighth note (A♭4), a sixteenth note (A♭4), and four sixteenth notes (E♭5, D♭5, C5, B♭4), which again total **2 beats**.
4. **Measure 4**: Contains one quarter note (A♭4), which is **2 beats**.

Thus, the melody consistently fits into **2 beats per measure**, indicating a **2/4 time signature**.
