To replace the quarter notes with x-shaped noteheads (representing placeholder rhythms) with appropriate rests, we must ensure that the total duration of each measure matches the time signature. Here's the analysis and solution for each measure containing these placeholder rhythms:

---

### Measure 1 (Time Signature: 4/2)
- Placeholder rhythm: Quarter note (1 beat in 4/2 time).
- Remaining duration in the measure: 4 beats (4/2) - (dotted quarter note [1.5 beats] + quarter note [1 beat] + sixteenth note [0.25 beats]) = 1.25 beats.
- Replace the placeholder with **a dotted half rest** (3 beats) to complete the measure.

---

### Measure 2 (Time Signature: 4/2)
- Placeholder rhythm: Quarter note (1 beat in 4/2 time).
- Remaining duration in the measure: 4 beats (4/2) - (triplet eighth notes [1 beat] + quarter note [1 beat]) = 2 beats.
- Replace the placeholder with **a half rest** (2 beats) to complete the measure.

---

### Measure 3 (Time Signature: 6/4)
- Placeholder rhythm: Quarter note (1 beat in 6/4 time).
- Remaining duration in the measure: 6 beats (6/4) - (sixteenth note [0.25 beats] + dotted eighth note [1.5 beats] + quarter note [1 beat] + dotted quarter note [1.5 beats]) = 1.75 beats.
- Replace the placeholder with **a dotted quarter rest** (1.5 beats) and **a sixteenth rest** (0.25 beats) to complete the measure.

---

### Measure 4 (Time Signature: 4/2)
- Placeholder rhythm: Quarter note (1 beat in 4/2 time).
- Remaining duration in the measure: 4 beats (4/2) - (quarter note [1 beat] + eighth note [0.5 beats] + eighth note [0.5 beats] + eighth note [0.5 beats] + eighth note [0.5 beats]) = 1 beat.
- Replace the placeholder with **a quarter rest** (1 beat) to complete the measure.

---

### Measure 5 (Time Signature: 9/8)
- Placeholder rhythm: Quarter note (2 beats in 9/8 time).
- Remaining duration in the measure: 9 beats (9/8) - (sixteenth note [0.5 beats] + eighth note [1 beat] + sixteenth note [0.5 beats]) = 7 beats.
- Replace the placeholder with **a dotted quarter rest** (3 beats) and **a dotted half rest** (4 beats) to complete the measure.

---

### Measure 6 (Time Signature: 9/8)
- Placeholder rhythm: Quarter note (2 beats in 9/8 time).
- Remaining duration in the measure: 9 beats (9/8) - (sixteenth note [0.5 beats] + eighth note [1 beat] + sixteenth note [0.5 beats] + sixteenth note [0.5 beats] + sixteenth note [0.5 beats] + sixteenth note [0.5 beats] + eighth note [1 beat]) = 4.5 beats.
- Replace the placeholder with **a dotted half rest** (4 beats) and **a sixteenth rest** (0.5 beats) to complete the measure.

---

### Measure 7 (Time Signature: 3/4)
- Placeholder rhythm: Quarter note (1 beat in 3/4 time).
- Remaining duration in the measure: 3 beats (3/4) - (quarter note [1 beat]) = 2 beats.
- Replace the placeholder with **a half rest** (2 beats) to complete the measure.

---

### Measure 8 (Time Signature: 3/4)
- Placeholder rhythm: Quarter note (1 beat in 3/4 time).
- Remaining duration in the measure: 3 beats (3/4) - (dotted sixteenth note [0.375 beats] + sixteenth rest [0.25 beats]) = 2.375 beats.
- Replace the placeholder with **a dotted half rest** (2 beats) and **a sixteenth rest** (0.375 beats) to complete the measure.

This ensures that all measures are rhythmically complete according to their respective time signatures.
