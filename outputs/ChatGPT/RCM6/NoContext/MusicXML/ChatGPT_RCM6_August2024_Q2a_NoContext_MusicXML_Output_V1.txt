To replace the quarter notes with x-shaped noteheads (representing placeholder rhythms) with appropriate rests, we must ensure that the total duration of each measure matches the time signature. Below is the analysis and solution for each measure containing these placeholder rhythms:

---

### Measure 1 (Time Signature: 4/2)
- Placeholder rhythm: Quarter note (1 beat in 4/2 time).
- Remaining duration: 4 beats (total) - 1 beat = **3 beats**.
- Solution: Replace the placeholder with a **dotted half rest** (3 beats).

---

### Measure 2 (Time Signature: 4/2)
- Placeholder rhythm: Quarter note (1 beat in 4/2 time).
- Remaining duration: 4 beats (total) - 1 beat = **3 beats**.
- Solution: Replace the placeholder with a **dotted half rest** (3 beats).

---

### Measure 3 (Time Signature: 6/4)
- Placeholder rhythm: Quarter note (1 beat in 6/4 time).
- Remaining duration: 6 beats (total) - 1 beat = **5 beats**.
- Solution: Replace the placeholder with a **dotted whole rest** (4 beats) and a **quarter rest** (1 beat).

---

### Measure 4 (Time Signature: 4/2)
- Placeholder rhythm: Quarter note (1 beat in 4/2 time).
- Remaining duration: 4 beats (total) - 1 beat = **3 beats**.
- Solution: Replace the placeholder with a **dotted half rest** (3 beats).

---

### Measure 5 (Time Signature: 9/8)
- Placeholder rhythm: Quarter note (2 beats in 9/8 time).
- Remaining duration: 9 beats (total) - 2 beats = **7 beats**.
- Solution: Replace the placeholder with a **dotted quarter rest** (3 beats) and a **quarter rest** (2 beats), followed by a **16th rest** (2 beats).

---

### Measure 6 (Time Signature: 9/8)
- Placeholder rhythm: Quarter note (2 beats in 9/8 time).
- Remaining duration: 9 beats (total) - 2 beats = **7 beats**.
- Solution: Replace the placeholder with a **dotted quarter rest** (3 beats) and a **quarter rest** (2 beats), followed by a **16th rest** (2 beats).

---

### Measure 7 (Time Signature: 3/4)
- Placeholder rhythm: Quarter note (1 beat in 3/4 time).
- Remaining duration: 3 beats (total) - 1 beat = **2 beats**.
- Solution: Replace the placeholder with a **half rest** (2 beats).

---

### Measure 8 (Time Signature: 3/4)
- Placeholder rhythm: Quarter note (1 beat in 3/4 time).
- Remaining duration: 3 beats (total) - 1 beat = **2 beats**.
- Solution: Replace the placeholder with a **half rest** (2 beats).

---

### Summary of Replacements:
- **4/2 time**: Replace with a **dotted half rest**.
- **6/4 time**: Replace with a **dotted whole rest** and a **quarter rest**.
- **9/8 time**: Replace with a **dotted quarter rest**, a **quarter rest**, and a **16th rest**.
- **3/4 time**: Replace with a **half rest**.
