To determine the intervals between the notes in each measure, we compare the pitches of the two notes in each measure. Here is the analysis:

### Measure 1:
- Notes: A4 and G5
- Interval: A4 to G5 is a **minor 7th** (m7).

### Measure 2:
- Notes: F#4 and Bb4
- Interval: F#4 to Bb4 is a **diminished 5th** (d5).

### Measure 3:
- Notes: E4 and C#5
- Interval: E4 to C#5 is a **major 6th** (M6).

### Measure 4:
- Notes: Cb5 and D5
- Interval: Cb5 to D5 is an **augmented 2nd** (A2).

### Measure 5:
- Notes: B4 and F#5
- Interval: B4 to F#5 is a **perfect 5th** (P5).

### Summary of Intervals:
1. Measure 1: Minor 7th (m7)
2. Measure 2: Diminished 5th (d5)
3. Measure 3: Major 6th (M6)
4. Measure 4: Augmented 2nd (A2)
5. Measure 5: Perfect 5th (P5)
