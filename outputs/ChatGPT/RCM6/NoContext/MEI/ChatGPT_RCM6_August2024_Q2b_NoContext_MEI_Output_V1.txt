The provided MEI file does not explicitly define a time signature in the `<scoreDef>` or within the measures themselves. Without a specified time signature, it is not possible to definitively determine the intended meter. However, we can analyze the rhythmic content of each measure to infer a possible time signature:

### Measure 1:
- Contains:
  - A dotted quarter note (1.5 beats in 4/4 time).
  - An eighth note (0.5 beats).
  - A group of sixteenth notes (2 notes, each 0.25 beats, totaling 0.5 beats).
  - Another eighth note (0.5 beats).
  - Two more eighth notes (0.5 + 0.5 = 1 beat).
- Total: 1.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 4 beats.
- **Inferred time signature: 4/4.**

### Measure 2:
- Contains:
  - A group of two sixteenth notes (0.25 + 0.25 = 0.5 beats).
  - Two thirty-second notes (0.125 + 0.125 = 0.25 beats).
  - A dotted sixteenth note (0.375 beats).
  - Another thirty-second note (0.125 beats).
  - A sixteenth note (0.25 beats).
  - An eighth note (0.5 beats).
  - A sixteenth note (0.25 beats).
- Total: 0.5 + 0.25 + 0.375 + 0.125 + 0.25 + 0.5 + 0.25 = 2.25 beats.
- This measure does not sum to a standard time signature, suggesting either incomplete notation or an irregular meter.

### Conclusion:
- Measure 1 aligns with **4/4**.
- Measure 2 does not fit a standard time signature and may require clarification or additional context.
