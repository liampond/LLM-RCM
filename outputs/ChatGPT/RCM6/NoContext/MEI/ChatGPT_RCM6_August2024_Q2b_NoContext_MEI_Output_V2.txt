To determine the time signature for each measure, we analyze the total rhythmic values of the notes in each measure. Here's the breakdown:

### Measure 1:
- **Note 1**: Dotted quarter note (duration = 1.5 beats in 4/4 time).
- **Note 2**: Eighth note (duration = 0.5 beats).
- **Beam 1**:
  - Two sixteenth notes (duration = 0.25 + 0.25 = 0.5 beats).
  - Eighth note (duration = 0.5 beats).
- **Beam 2**:
  - Two eighth notes (duration = 0.5 + 0.5 = 1 beat).

**Total duration**: 1.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 1 = **4 beats**.

Thus, **Measure 1 is in 4/4 time**.

### Measure 2:
- **Beam 1**:
  - Two sixteenth notes (duration = 0.25 + 0.25 = 0.5 beats).
  - Two thirty-second notes (duration = 0.125 + 0.125 = 0.25 beats).
- **Beam 2**:
  - Dotted sixteenth note (duration = 0.375 beats).
  - Thirty-second note (duration = 0.125 beats).
  - Sixteenth note (duration = 0.25 beats).
- **Beam 3**:
  - Eighth note (duration = 0.5 beats).
  - Sixteenth note (duration = 0.25 beats).

**Total duration**: 0.5 + 0.25 + 0.375 + 0.125 + 0.25 + 0.5 + 0.25 = **2 beats**.

Thus, **Measure 2 is in 2/4 time**.

### Conclusion:
- Measure 1: **4/4 time**.
- Measure 2: **2/4 time**.
