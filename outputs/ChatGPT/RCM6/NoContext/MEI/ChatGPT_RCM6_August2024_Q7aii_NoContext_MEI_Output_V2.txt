### Key of the Melody:
The key signature is specified as **5 flats (5f)**, which corresponds to **D-flat major** or its relative minor, **B-flat minor**. Since the melody prominently features **A-flat (flattened)** and **D-flat (flattened)**, it is consistent with **D-flat major**.

### Time Signature:
The time signature is not explicitly provided, so we must infer it from the rhythmic structure:

1. **Measure 0**: Contains a single eighth note (1/8).
2. **Measure 1**: Contains four eighth notes (4/8).
3. **Measure 2**: Contains one quarter note (2/8) and two eighth notes (2/8), totaling 4/8.
4. **Measure 3**: Contains a dotted eighth note (3/16), a sixteenth note (1/16), and four sixteenth notes (4/16), totaling 8/16 = 4/8.
5. **Measure 4**: Contains one quarter note (2/8).

From this, the melody consistently fits into **4/8 time** (or 2/4, depending on interpretation). The most likely inferred time signature is **2/4**.
