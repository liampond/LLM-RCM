The melody in the provided MEI file is in E major (key signature of 4 sharps). To transpose it to A-flat major (key signature of 4 flats), we need to transpose the melody up by a **minor third** (3 semitones). Below is the transposed melody with the correct notes, rhythms, and accidentals:

---

### Key Signature: A-flat major (4 flats: B♭, E♭, A♭, D♭)

#### Measure 1:
1. **E4 (half note)** → **G4 (half note)**
2. **G♯4 (quarter note)** → **B♭4 (quarter note)**
3. **B4 (quarter note)** → **D5 (quarter note)**

#### Measure 2:
1. **D♯4 (dotted quarter note)** → **F4 (dotted quarter note)**
2. **E4 (16th note)** → **G4 (16th note)**
3. **F♯4 (16th note)** → **A♭4 (16th note)**
4. **E4 (quarter note)** → **G4 (quarter note)**
5. **Rest (quarter note)** → **Rest (quarter note)**

#### Measure 3:
1. **C♯5 (half note)** → **E♭5 (half note)**
2. **B4 (quarter note)** → **D5 (quarter note)**
3. **E5 (quarter note)** → **G5 (quarter note)**

#### Measure 4:
1. **B4 (quarter note)** → **D5 (quarter note)**
2. **A4 (eighth note)** → **C5 (eighth note)**
3. **G♯4 (16th note)** → **B♭4 (16th note)**
4. **A4 (16th note)** → **C5 (16th note)**
5. **G♯4 (quarter note)** → **B♭4 (quarter note)**
6. **Rest (quarter note)** → **Rest (quarter note)**
