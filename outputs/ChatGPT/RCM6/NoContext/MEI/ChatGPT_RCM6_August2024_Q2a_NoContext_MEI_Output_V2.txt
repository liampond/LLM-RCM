To replace the quarter notes with x-shaped noteheads (representing placeholder rhythms) with appropriate rests, we must ensure that each measure adheres to its respective time signature. Here's the breakdown:

---

### Measure 1 (4/2 time signature):
- Placeholder rhythm: 1 quarter note (x-shaped).
- Remaining duration: 4/2 = 8 quarter notes total. The measure already contains a dotted whole note (6 quarter notes) and a sixteenth note (1/4 quarter note).
- Missing duration: 8 - (6 + 1/4) = 1 3/4 quarter notes.
- Solution: Replace the x-shaped quarter note with **a dotted half rest and a sixteenth rest**.

---

### Measure 2 (4/2 time signature):
- Placeholder rhythm: 1 quarter note (x-shaped).
- Remaining duration: 4/2 = 8 quarter notes total. The measure contains a triplet of eighth notes (1 quarter note) and a sixteenth note (1/4 quarter note).
- Missing duration: 8 - (1 + 1/4) = 6 3/4 quarter notes.
- Solution: Replace the x-shaped quarter note with **a dotted whole rest and a sixteenth rest**.

---

### Measure 3 (6/4 time signature):
- Placeholder rhythm: 1 quarter note (x-shaped).
- Remaining duration: 6/4 = 6 quarter notes total. The measure contains a sixteenth note (1/4 quarter note), a dotted eighth note (3/4 quarter note), and a dotted whole note (6 quarter notes).
- Missing duration: 6 - (1/4 + 3/4 + 6) = 0.
- Solution: The measure is already complete. **No additional rests are needed.**

---

### Measure 4 (6/4 time signature):
- Placeholder rhythm: 1 quarter note (x-shaped).
- Remaining duration: 6/4 = 6 quarter notes total. The measure contains an eighth note (1/2 quarter note), a beam of two eighth notes (1 quarter note), and a quarter note (1 quarter note).
- Missing duration: 6 - (1/2 + 1 + 1) = 3 1/2 quarter notes.
- Solution: Replace the x-shaped quarter note with **a dotted half rest and a half rest**.

---

### Measure 5 (9/8 time signature):
- Placeholder rhythm: 1 quarter note (x-shaped).
- Remaining duration: 9/8 = 9 eighth notes total. The measure contains a sixteenth note (1/2 eighth note), an eighth note (1 eighth note), and another sixteenth note (1/2 eighth note).
- Missing duration: 9 - (1/2 + 1 + 1/2) = 7 eighth notes.
- Solution: Replace the x-shaped quarter note with **a dotted quarter rest and a dotted half rest**.

---

### Measure 6 (9/8 time signature):
- Placeholder rhythm: 1 quarter note (x-shaped).
- Remaining duration: 9/8 = 9 eighth notes total. The measure contains a sixteenth note (1/2 eighth note), an eighth note (1 eighth note), and a beam of five sixteenth notes (2 1/2 eighth notes).
- Missing duration: 9 - (1/2 + 1 + 2 1/2) = 5 eighth notes.
- Solution: Replace the x-shaped quarter note with **a dotted half rest**.

---

### Measure 7 (3/4 time signature):
- Placeholder rhythm: 1 quarter note (x-shaped).
- Remaining duration: 3/4 = 3 quarter notes total. The measure contains only the x-shaped quarter note.
- Missing duration: 3 - 1 = 2 quarter notes.
- Solution: Replace the x-shaped quarter note with **a half rest**.

---

### Measure 8 (3/4 time signature):
- Placeholder rhythm: 1 quarter note (x-shaped).
- Remaining duration: 3/4 = 3 quarter notes total. The measure contains a dotted sixteenth note (3/8 quarter note).
- Missing duration: 3 - (3/8) = 2 5/8 quarter notes.
- Solution: Replace the x-shaped quarter note with **a dotted half rest and a sixteenth rest**.

This ensures that all measures are rhythmically complete according to their respective time signatures.
