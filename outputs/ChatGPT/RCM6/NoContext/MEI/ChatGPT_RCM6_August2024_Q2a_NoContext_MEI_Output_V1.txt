To replace the quarter notes with x-shaped noteheads (representing placeholder rhythms) with appropriate rests, we must ensure that each measure adheres to its respective time signature. Here's the breakdown:

---

### Measure 1 (4/2 time signature):
- Placeholder rhythm: 1 quarter note (x-shaped notehead).
- Remaining duration: 4/2 = 8 quarter notes. The placeholder occupies 1 quarter note, leaving **7 quarter notes**.
- Solution: Replace the placeholder with **a dotted whole rest (6 quarter notes)** and **a quarter rest**.

---

### Measure 2 (4/2 time signature):
- Placeholder rhythm: 1 quarter note (x-shaped notehead).
- Remaining duration: 4/2 = 8 quarter notes. The placeholder occupies 1 quarter note, leaving **7 quarter notes**.
- Solution: Replace the placeholder with **a dotted whole rest (6 quarter notes)** and **a quarter rest**.

---

### Measure 3 (6/4 time signature):
- Placeholder rhythm: 1 quarter note (x-shaped notehead).
- Remaining duration: 6/4 = 6 quarter notes. The placeholder occupies 1 quarter note, leaving **5 quarter notes**.
- Solution: Replace the placeholder with **a whole rest (4 quarter notes)** and **a quarter rest**.

---

### Measure 4 (6/4 time signature):
- Placeholder rhythm: 1 quarter note (x-shaped notehead).
- Remaining duration: 6/4 = 6 quarter notes. The placeholder occupies 1 quarter note, leaving **5 quarter notes**.
- Solution: Replace the placeholder with **a whole rest (4 quarter notes)** and **a quarter rest**.

---

### Measure 5 (9/8 time signature):
- Placeholder rhythm: 1 quarter note (x-shaped notehead).
- Remaining duration: 9/8 = 9 eighth notes. The placeholder occupies 2 eighth notes, leaving **7 eighth notes**.
- Solution: Replace the placeholder with **a dotted quarter rest (3 eighth notes)** and **a half rest (4 eighth notes)**.

---

### Measure 6 (9/8 time signature):
- Placeholder rhythm: 1 quarter note (x-shaped notehead).
- Remaining duration: 9/8 = 9 eighth notes. The placeholder occupies 2 eighth notes, leaving **7 eighth notes**.
- Solution: Replace the placeholder with **a dotted quarter rest (3 eighth notes)** and **a half rest (4 eighth notes)**.

---

### Measure 7 (3/4 time signature):
- Placeholder rhythm: 1 quarter note (x-shaped notehead).
- Remaining duration: 3/4 = 3 quarter notes. The placeholder occupies 1 quarter note, leaving **2 quarter notes**.
- Solution: Replace the placeholder with **a half rest (2 quarter notes)**.

---

### Measure 8 (3/4 time signature):
- Placeholder rhythm: 1 quarter note (x-shaped notehead).
- Remaining duration: 3/4 = 3 quarter notes. The placeholder occupies 1 quarter note, leaving **2 quarter notes**.
- Solution: Replace the placeholder with **a half rest (2 quarter notes)**.

This ensures that all measures are rhythmically complete according to their respective time signatures.
