### Time Signature:
The time signature is not explicitly provided, so we must infer it from the rhythmic structure:

1. **Measure 0**: Contains a single eighth note (dur="8").
2. **Measure 1**: Contains four eighth notes (dur="8"), grouped into two beams.
3. **Measure 2**: Contains one quarter note (dur="4") and two eighth notes (dur="8"), totaling 4 eighth-note beats.
4. **Measure 3**: Contains a dotted eighth note (dur="8", dots="1"), a sixteenth note (dur="16"), and four additional sixteenth notes (dur="16"), totaling 4 eighth-note beats.
5. **Measure 4**: Contains one quarter note (dur="4"), equivalent to 2 eighth-note beats.

From this, the melody consistently fits into **4 eighth-note beats per measure**, suggesting a **2/4 time signature**.
