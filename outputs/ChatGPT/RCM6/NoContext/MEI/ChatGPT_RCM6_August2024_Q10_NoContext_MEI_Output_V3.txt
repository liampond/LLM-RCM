1. **Key of the piece**: The key signature has one flat, and the melodic and harmonic content suggests the piece is in **F major**.

2. **Time signature**: The rhythmic content consistently groups into **6/8** time. Each measure contains six eighth-note beats, often grouped into two dotted-quarter-note pulses.

3. **Chord outlined by the first three eighth notes of bar 2 (both hands)**:  
   - Right hand: D (octave 6), B♭ (octave 5), D (octave 6).  
   - Left hand: F (octave 3), B♭ (octave 3), D (octave 4).  
   This outlines a **B♭ major triad**, which is the **subdominant triad** (IV) in F major.

4. **Interval between the last eighth note in the left hand of bar 2 and the first note in the left hand of bar 3**:  
   - Last note of bar 2 (LH): D (octave 4).  
   - First note of bar 3 (LH): B♭ (octave 3).  
   The interval is a **minor seventh** (D down to B♭).

5. **Functional chord symbol for the chord outlined by the first three eighth notes of bar 5 (both hands)**:  
   - Right hand: F (octave 6), C (octave 6), A (octave 5).  
   - Left hand: F (octave 3), A (octave 3), C (octave 4).  
   This outlines an **F major triad**, which is the **tonic chord (I)** in F major.

6. **Chord outlined by the last three eighth notes of bar 7 (both hands)**:  
   - Right hand: B♭ (octave 5), G (octave 5), E (octave 5).  
   - Left hand: G (octave 3), B♭ (octave 3), E (octave 4).  
   This outlines an **E diminished triad**, which functions as **vii°** in F major.

7. **Interval between the second eighth note in the left hand of bar 8 and the third eighth note in the left hand of bar 8**:  
   - Second note: E (octave 3).  
   - Third note: B♭ (octave 3).  
   The interval is a **diminished fifth** (E to B♭).

8. **Rest at the end of bar 8 in the right hand**: After the F (dotted quarter note), there is one eighth note of silence remaining. The rest should be an **eighth rest**.

9. **Parallel or contrasting period**: The passage is an example of a **contrasting period**, as the melodic material in the antecedent and consequent phrases is different.

10. **Meaning of "allegretto vivace"**:
