To determine the intervals between the notes in each measure, we analyze the pitch names, octaves, and accidentals provided in the MEI file. The key signature is **D major (2 sharps: F# and C#)**, so accidentals are interpreted accordingly.

### Measure 1:
- Notes: A4 and G5
- Interval: **Minor 7th (A4 to G5)**

### Measure 2:
- Notes: F#4 and B♭4
  - F# is in the key signature.
  - B♭ has an explicit flat accidental.
- Interval: **Diminished 5th (F#4 to B♭4)**

### Measure 3:
- Notes: E4 and C#5
  - C# is in the key signature.
- Interval: **Major 6th (E4 to C#5)**

### Measure 4:
- Notes: C♮5 and D5
  - C♮ has an explicit natural accidental.
- Interval: **Major 2nd (C♮5 to D5)**

### Measure 5:
- Notes: B4 and F#5
  - F# is in the key signature.
- Interval: **Diminished 5th (B4 to F#5)**

### Summary of Intervals:
1. Minor 7th
2. Diminished 5th
3. Major 6th
