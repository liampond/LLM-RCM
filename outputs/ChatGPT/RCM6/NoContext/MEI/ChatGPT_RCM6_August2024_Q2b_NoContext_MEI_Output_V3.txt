To determine the time signature for each measure, we analyze the total rhythmic values of the notes in each measure. Here's the breakdown:

### Measure 1:
- **Notes:**
  - Dotted quarter note (4 + 2 = 6 PPQ)
  - Eighth note (4 PPQ)
  - Sixteenth note (2 PPQ)
  - Sixteenth note (2 PPQ)
  - Eighth note (4 PPQ)
  - Eighth note (4 PPQ)
- **Total rhythmic value:** 6 + 4 + 2 + 2 + 4 + 4 = **22 PPQ**.

This does not correspond to a standard time signature. It is possible that the measure is incomplete or irregular.

### Measure 2:
- **Notes:**
  - Sixteenth note (2 PPQ)
  - Sixteenth note (2 PPQ)
  - Thirty-second note (1 PPQ)
  - Thirty-second note (1 PPQ)
  - Dotted sixteenth note (3 PPQ)
  - Thirty-second note (1 PPQ)
  - Sixteenth note (2 PPQ)
  - Eighth note (4 PPQ)
  - Sixteenth note (2 PPQ)
- **Total rhythmic value:** 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 = **18 PPQ**.

This also does not correspond to a standard time signature. Measure 2 may also be irregular or incomplete.

### Conclusion:
Both measures appear to have irregular or incomplete rhythmic values, making it impossible to infer a standard time signature (e.g., 4/4, 3/4, etc.) from the given data. Additional context or information about the piece would be necessary to clarify the intended time signature.
