#### 2. **Time Signature**:
The rhythm in each measure suggests a **6/8 time signature**. This is inferred from the grouping of eighth notes into two beats per measure, with each beat subdivided into three eighth notes.

#### 4. **Chord Symbol in Bar 2**:
- Notes: D, B, F# (sharp), E, D.
- These notes imply a **D major chord** (D, F#, A), with passing tones (B and E).

---

#### 5. **Chord Symbol in Bar 3**:
- Notes: C# (sharp), D# (sharp), E# (sharp), G# (sharp), F# (sharp), E# (sharp).
