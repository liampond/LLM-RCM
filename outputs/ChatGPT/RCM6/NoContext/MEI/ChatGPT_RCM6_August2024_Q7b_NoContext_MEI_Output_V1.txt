### Analysis of the Melody:

#### 1. **Key of the Melody**:
The key signature has three sharps (`3s`), which indicates either A major or F# minor. Based on the melodic content (frequent use of F#, C#, and G#), the melody is in **A major**.

---

#### 2. **Time Signature**:
The rhythm in each measure suggests a **6/8 time signature**:
- Bar 1: A dotted quarter note (1 beat) + three eighth notes (1.5 beats) = 2 beats in 6/8.
- Bar 2: A dotted quarter note (1 beat) + three eighth notes (1.5 beats) = 2 beats in 6/8.
- Bar 3: Two groups of three eighth notes = 2 beats in 6/8.
- Bar 4: A dotted half note (2 beats) = 2 beats in 6/8.

Thus, the inferred time signature is **6/8**.

#### 4. **Chord Symbol in Bar 2**:
- Notes: D (dotted quarter), B, F#, E, D.
- These notes outline a **D major chord** (D, F#, A), with passing tones (B, E).
- Chord: **D**.

---

#### 5. **Chord Symbol in Bar 3**:
- Notes: C#, D, E, G#, F#, E.
- These notes outline an **A major chord** (A, C#, E), with passing tones (D, G#, F#).
- Chord: **A**.

---

#### 6. **Chord Symbol in Bar 4**:

- The sustained F# suggests an **F# minor chord** (F#, A, C#), as no other notes are present to contradict this.
- Chord: **F#m**.
