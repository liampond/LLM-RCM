### Key of the Melody:
The key signature indicates **1 sharp**, which corresponds to either **G major** or **E minor**. Based on the melodic content, particularly the frequent use of **D**, **G**, and **B**, the melody is most likely in **G major**.

### Time Signature:
The time signature is not explicitly stated, so we must infer it from the rhythmic structure. 

- Measure 0 contains a single **16th note** (1/16 duration).
- Measure 1 contains **12 sixteenth notes**, grouped into four beams of three notes each.
- Measure 2 contains **12 sixteenth notes** and one **eighth note** (2/16 duration), totaling **14 sixteenth notes**.

The grouping of notes into sets of **three sixteenth notes** suggests a **compound meter**. The most plausible time signature is **12/16**, as it accommodates the rhythmic structure of 12 sixteenth notes per measure in Measure 1 and aligns with the compound feel.
