The melody in the provided MEI file is in the key of E major (4 sharps: F#, C#, G#, D#). To transpose it to A-flat major (4 flats: Bb, Eb, Ab, Db), we need to transpose the melody up by a **minor third** (3 semitones). Below is the transposed melody with the correct notes, rhythms, and accidentals:

---

### Key Signature: A-flat major (4 flats)

#### Measure 1:
1. **E4 (half note)** → **G4 (half note)**
2. **G#4 (quarter note)** → **Bb4 (quarter note)**
3. **B4 (quarter note)** → **Db5 (quarter note)**

#### Measure 2:
1. **D#4 (dotted quarter note)** → **F4 (dotted quarter note)**
2. **E4 (16th note)** → **G4 (16th note)**
3. **F#4 (16th note)** → **Ab4 (16th note)**
4. **E4 (quarter note)** → **G4 (quarter note)**
5. **Rest (quarter note)** → **Rest (quarter note)**

#### Measure 3:
1. **C#5 (half note)** → **Eb5 (half note)**
2. **B4 (quarter note)** → **Db5 (quarter note)**
3. **E5 (quarter note)** → **G5 (quarter note)**

#### Measure 4:
1. **B4 (quarter note)** → **Db5 (quarter note)**
2. **A4 (eighth note)** → **C5 (eighth note)**
3. **G#4 (16th note)** → **Bb4 (16th note)**
4. **A4 (16th note)** → **C5 (16th note)**
5. **G#4 (quarter note)** → **Bb4 (quarter note)**
6. **Rest (quarter note)** → **Rest (quarter note)**

### Interval of Transposition:
The interval of transposition is a **minor third up**.
