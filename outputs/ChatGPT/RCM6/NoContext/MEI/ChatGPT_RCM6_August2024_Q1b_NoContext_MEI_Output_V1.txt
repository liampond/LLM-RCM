To determine the requested intervals, we will analyze the notes and their accidentals carefully. Here's the breakdown:

1. **A perfect 4th above the first note in the file:**
   - The first note is **B♭2** (B with a flat accidental in octave 2).
   - A perfect 4th above B♭ is **E♭**.
   - Therefore, the note is **E♭3**.

2. **A major 3rd above the second note in the file:**
   - The second note is **D♯3** (D with a sharp accidental in octave 3).
   - A major 3rd above D♯ is **F♯**.
   - Therefore, the note is **F♯3**.

3. **A diminished 8ve above the third note in the file:**
   - The third note is **G♭2** (G with a flat accidental in octave 2).
   - A diminished 8ve (octave) above G♭ is **G♭3** (since a diminished octave is the same pitch class but one octave higher).
   - Therefore, the note is **G♭3**.

4. **An augmented 6th above the fourth note in the file:**
   - The fourth note is **C♭3** (C with a flat accidental in octave 3).
   - An augmented 6th above C♭ is **A♯**.
   - Therefore, the note is **A♯4**.

5. **A minor 2nd above the fifth note in the file:**
   - The fifth note is **E2** (E natural in octave 2).
   - A minor 2nd above E is **F**.
   - Therefore, the note is **F2**.

### Final Answers:
1. **E♭3**  
2. **F♯3**  
3. **G♭3**  
4. **A♯4**  
5. **F2**
