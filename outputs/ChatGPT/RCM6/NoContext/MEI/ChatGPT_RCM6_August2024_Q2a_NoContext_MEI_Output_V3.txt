To replace the quarter notes with x-shaped noteheads (placeholders) with appropriate rests, we must ensure that each measure adheres to its respective time signature. Here's the breakdown:

---

### Measure 1 (4/2 time signature):
- Contains:
  - A dotted whole note (7 beats in quarter-note terms).
  - A quarter note placeholder (1 beat).
  - A sixteenth note (0.25 beats).
- Total: 7 + 1 + 0.25 = 8.25 beats.
- **Correction**: The measure is overfilled by 0.25 beats. Remove the placeholder entirely, as the dotted whole note and sixteenth note already complete the measure.

---

### Measure 2 (4/2 time signature):
- Contains:
  - A triplet of eighth notes (1 beat total).
  - A quarter note placeholder (1 beat).
- Total: 1 + 1 = 2 beats.
- **Correction**: Add a half rest (2 beats) to complete the measure.

---

### Measure 3 (6/4 time signature):
- Contains:
  - A sixteenth note (0.25 beats).
  - A dotted eighth note (0.75 beats).
  - A quarter note placeholder (1 beat).
  - A dotted half note (3 beats).
- Total: 0.25 + 0.75 + 1 + 3 = 5 beats.
- **Correction**: Add a quarter rest (1 beat) to complete the measure.

---

### Measure 4 (6/4 time signature):
- Contains:
  - A quarter note placeholder (1 beat).
  - An eighth note (0.5 beats).
  - Two beamed eighth notes (1 beat total).
  - A quarter note (1 beat).
- Total: 1 + 0.5 + 1 + 1 = 3.5 beats.
- **Correction**: Add a dotted half rest (2.5 beats) to complete the measure.

---

### Measure 5 (9/8 time signature):
- Contains:
  - A sixteenth note (0.5 beats).
  - A dotted eighth note (1.5 beats).
  - A sixteenth note (0.5 beats).
  - A quarter note placeholder (2 beats).
- Total: 0.5 + 1.5 + 0.5 + 2 = 4.5 beats.
- **Correction**: Add a dotted quarter rest (3 beats) and a quarter rest (1.5 beats) to complete the measure.

---

### Measure 6 (9/8 time signature):
- Contains:
  - A sixteenth note (0.5 beats).
  - A quarter note placeholder (2 beats).
  - An eighth note (1 beat).
  - A group of five sixteenth notes (2.5 beats).
- Total: 0.5 + 2 + 1 + 2.5 = 6 beats.
- **Correction**: Add a dotted quarter rest (3 beats) to complete the measure.

---

### Measure 7 (3/4 time signature):
- Contains:
  - A quarter note placeholder (1 beat).
- Total: 1 beat.
- **Correction**: Add a half rest (2 beats) to complete the measure.

---

### Measure 8 (3/4 time signature):
- Contains:
  - A dotted sixteenth note (0.375 beats).
  - A quarter note placeholder (1 beat).
- Total: 0.375 + 1 = 1.375 beats.
- **Correction**: Add a dotted eighth rest (0.375 beats) and a quarter rest (1.25 beats) to complete the measure.

This ensures all measures are rhythmically complete according to their respective time signatures.
