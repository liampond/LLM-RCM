### Key of the Melody:
The key signature indicates **1 sharp**, which corresponds to either **G major** or **E minor**. Based on the melodic content, particularly the frequent use of **G**, **A**, **B**, and **C**, the melody is most likely in **G major**.

### Time Signature:
The time signature is not explicitly stated, so we must infer it from the rhythmic structure:

1. **Measure 1**: Contains a sixteenth rest followed by five sixteenth notes. This totals **6 sixteenth notes**.
2. **Measure 2**: Contains six sixteenth notes.
3. **Measure 3**: Contains two thirty-second notes, one sixteenth note, one eighth note, and an eighth rest. This totals **6 sixteenth notes**.
4. **Measure 4**: Contains two thirty-second notes, one sixteenth note, one eighth note, and an eighth rest. This also totals **6 sixteenth notes**.

Each measure consistently adds up to **6 sixteenth notes**, which suggests the time signature is **6/16**. 

### Final Answer:
- **Key**: G major  
- **Time Signature**: 6/16
