### Key of the Melody:
The key signature indicates **1 sharp**, which corresponds to either **G major** or **E minor**. Based on the melodic content, particularly the frequent use of **G**, **A**, **B**, and **C** (with no strong emphasis on E or D#), the melody is most likely in **G major**.

### Time Signature of the Melody:
To infer the time signature, we analyze the rhythmic structure:

1. **Measure 1**:
   - A sixteenth rest (1/16) followed by five sixteenth notes (5/16).
   - Total: **6/16**.

2. **Measure 2**:
   - Six sixteenth notes (6/16).
   - Total: **6/16**.

3. **Measure 3**:
   - Two thirty-second notes (2/32 = 1/16), one sixteenth note (1/16), one eighth note (2/16), and an eighth rest (2/16).
   - Total: **6/16**.

4. **Measure 4**:
   - Two thirty-second notes (2/32 = 1/16), one sixteenth note (1/16), one eighth note (2/16), and an eighth rest (2/16).
   - Total: **6/16**.

Each measure consistently adds up to **6/16**, which simplifies to **3/8**. Therefore, the inferred time signature is **3/8**.
