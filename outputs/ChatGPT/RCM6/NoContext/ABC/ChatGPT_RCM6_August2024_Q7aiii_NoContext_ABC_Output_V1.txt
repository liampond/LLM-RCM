### Key of the Melody:
The key signature is **G major** (one sharp, F#). However, the melody contains accidentals such as ^D (D#) and ^C (C#), which suggest a modulation or chromaticism. The presence of these accidentals could imply a temporary shift to **A major** or **E minor** (relative minor of G major), but the overall key remains **G major** based on the key signature.

### Time Signature:
The melody's rhythm must be analyzed to infer the time signature. Breaking it down:

1. **First measure**: `z GABcA`  
   - The notes are sixteenth notes (L:1/16), so this measure contains 5 sixteenth notes and a sixteenth rest. Total = 6 sixteenth notes.

2. **Second measure**: `BGFE^DA`  
   - This measure contains 6 sixteenth notes.

3. **Third measure**: `G/F/Ee2 z2`  
   - `G/F/E` are sixteenth notes (3 sixteenths), `e2` is an eighth note (2 sixteenths), and `z2` is another eighth note (2 sixteenths). Total = 7 sixteenth notes.

4. **Fourth measure**: `^d/^c/Ba2 z2`  
   - `^d/^c/B` are sixteenth notes (3 sixteenths), `a2` is an eighth note (2 sixteenths), and `z2` is another eighth note (2 sixteenths). Total = 7 sixteenth notes.

The irregular grouping of sixteenth notes (6, 6, 7, 7) suggests that the time signature is **irregular**. A plausible interpretation is **7/16**, as the measures with 7 sixteenth notes dominate the rhythm. However, the first two measures could imply a shift between **6/16** and **7/16**. 

Final Answer: The melody is in an **irregular time signature**, likely alternating between **6/16** and **7/16**, or simply **7/16**.
