1. **First note in the file**: `_B,,` (B double flat in the bass clef).
   - A **perfect 4th** above `_B,,` is **_E,,** (E double flat). 

2. **Second note in the file**: `^D,` (D sharp in the bass clef).
   - A **major 3rd** above `^D,` is **F##,** (F double sharp).

3. **Third note in the file**: `_G,,` (G double flat in the bass clef).
   - A **diminished 8ve** above `_G,,` is **_G,** (G flat).

### Final Answers:
- Perfect 4th above `_B,,`: **_E,,**
- Major 3rd above `^D,`: **F##,**
- Diminished 8ve above `_G,,`: **_G,**
- Augmented 6th above `_C,`: **A**
- Minor 2nd above `E,,`: **F,,**
