Let's analyze the intervals between the notes in each measure. The key signature is **D major**, but accidentals and note spellings will be carefully considered.

### Measure 1: [Ag]  
- Notes: A and G  
- Interval: **minor 7th** (A to G is a minor 7th descending).

### Measure 2: [F_B]  
- Notes: F and B  
- Interval: **augmented 4th** (F to B is an augmented 4th ascending).

### Measure 3: [Ec]  
- Notes: E and C  
- Interval: **minor 6th** (E to C is a minor 6th descending).

### Measure 4: [_cd]  
- Notes: C♯ and D  
- Interval: **minor 2nd** (C♯ to D is a minor 2nd ascending).

### Measure 5: [Bf]  
- Notes: B and F  
- Interval: **diminished 5th** (B to F is a diminished 5th descending).

### Summary of Intervals:
1. Minor 7th  
2. Augmented 4th  
3. Minor 6th  
4. Minor 2nd  
5. Diminished 5th
