To determine the intervals between the notes in each measure, we analyze the pitch relationships within the chords. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Measure 1: [Ag]**
   - Notes: A and G
   - Interval: A to G is a **minor 7th (m7)** descending.

2. **Measure 2: [F_B]**
   - Notes: F and B
   - Interval: F to B is a **tritone (augmented 4th or diminished 5th)** ascending.

3. **Measure 3: [Ec]**
   - Notes: E and C
   - Interval: E to C is a **minor 6th (m6)** descending.

4. **Measure 4: [_cd]**
   - Notes: C♯ and D
   - Interval: C♯ to D is a **minor 2nd (m2)** ascending.

5. **Measure 5: [Bf]**
   - Notes: B and F
   - Interval: B to F is a **tritone (augmented 4th or diminished 5th)** descending.

### Summary of Intervals:
- Measure 1: Minor 7th (descending)
- Measure 2: Tritone (ascending)
- Measure 3: Minor 6th (descending)
- Measure 4: Minor 2nd (ascending)
- Measure 5: Tritone (descending)
