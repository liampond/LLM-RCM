To replace the placeholder rhythms (quarter notes with x-shaped noteheads) with appropriate rests, we need to ensure that each measure adheres to the specified time signature. Let's analyze each measure step by step:

### Measure-by-measure analysis:
1. **Measure 1 (M:4/2)**:  
   - Notes: `F3 F2 F/`  
   - Total duration so far:  
     - `F3` = 3 beats  
     - `F2` = 2 beats  
     - `F/` = 1/8 beat  
   - Total = 5 + 1/8 beats.  
   - A 4/2 measure requires 8 beats.  
   - Missing duration = 8 - (5 + 1/8) = 2 7/8 beats.  
   - Replace the missing duration with rests: `2 7/8` = `2` beats (minim rest) + `7/8` (dotted quarter rest + 1/8 rest).

2. **Measure 2 (M:4/2)**:  
   - Notes: `(3FFF F2`  
   - `(3FFF` is a triplet, so it equals 2 beats.  
   - `F2` = 2 beats.  
   - Total = 4 beats.  
   - Missing duration = 8 - 4 = 4 beats.  
   - Replace the missing duration with a semibreve rest.

3. **Measure 3 (M:6/4)**:  
   - Notes: `F<F F2 F3`  
   - `F<F` = 1 beat (grace note-like notation).  
   - `F2` = 2 beats.  
   - `F3` = 3 beats.  
   - Total = 6 beats.  
   - No missing duration; this measure is complete.

4. **Measure 4 (M:6/4)**:  
   - Notes: `F2 F FF F2`  
   - `F2` = 2 beats.  
   - `F` = 1 beat.  
   - `FF` = 2 beats.  
   - `F2` = 2 beats.  
   - Total = 7 beats.  
   - This measure exceeds the time signature (6 beats). Likely an error in the encoding.

5. **Measure 5 (M:9/8)**:  
   - Notes: `F/FF/ F2`  
   - `F/FF/` = 3/8 beats.  
   - `F2` = 6/8 beats.  
   - Total = 9/8 beats.  
   - No missing duration; this measure is complete.

6. **Measure 6 (M:9/8)**:  
   - Notes: `F/ F2 F F/F/F/F/F`  
   - `F/` = 1/8 beat.  
   - `F2` = 6/8 beats.  
   - `F/F/F/F/F` = 5/8 beats.  
   - Total = 12/8 beats.  
   - This measure exceeds the time signature (9/8). Likely an error in the encoding.

7. **Measure 7 (M:3/4)**:  
   - Notes: `F2`  
   - `F2` = 2 beats.  
   - A 3/4 measure requires 3 beats.  
   - Missing duration = 3 - 2 = 1 beat.  
   - Replace the missing duration with a quarter rest.

8. **Measure 8 (M:3/4)**:  
   - Notes: `F3/4 F2`  
   - `F3/4` = 3/4 beat.  
   - `F2` = 2 beats.  
   - Total = 2 3/4 beats.  
   - Missing duration = 3 - 2 3/4 = 1/4 beat.  
   - Replace the missing duration with a 1/4 rest.

### Final replacements:
- **Measure 1**: Add a minim rest + dotted quarter rest + 1/8 rest.  
- **Measure 2**: Add a semibreve rest.  
- **Measure 3**: No changes needed.  
- **Measure 4**: Exceeds time signature; needs correction.  
- **Measure 5**: No changes needed.  
- **Measure 6**: Exceeds time signature; needs correction.  
- **Measure 7**: Add a quarter rest.  
- **Measure 8**: Add a 1/4 rest.
