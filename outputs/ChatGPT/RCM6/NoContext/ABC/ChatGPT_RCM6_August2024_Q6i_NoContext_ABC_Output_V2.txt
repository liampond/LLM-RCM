Here is the requested analysis of the melody:

1. **Key of the melody**: E-flat major (indicated by `K:Eb`).

2. **Root/quality chord symbol of the second last chord**: G minor (Gm). The notes present are G, B♭, and D.

3. **Root/quality chord symbol of the last chord**: E-flat major (E♭). The notes present are E♭, G, and C (C is a doubling of the tonic chord's third, which is common in piano writing).

4. **Functional chord symbol for the second last chord**: vi (the submediant chord in E♭ major).

5. **Functional chord symbol for the last chord**: I (the tonic chord in E♭ major).

6. **Type of cadence**: Authentic cadence (vi to I is a deceptive progression, but the final I chord resolves the phrase conclusively, making it an authentic cadence overall).
