### Key of the Melody:
The key of the melody is **D-flat major**. This is explicitly indicated by the `K:Db` in the ABC notation.

### Time Signature of the Melody:
The time signature is not explicitly stated (`M:?`), so we must infer it from the rhythms. Here's the breakdown:

1. The melody uses a note length of `L:1/8`, meaning each written note corresponds to an eighth note.
2. The first measure contains **dd ff**, which are four eighth notes, suggesting a grouping of four beats.
3. The second measure contains **d2 AA**, where `d2` is a quarter note (two eighths) and `AA` are two eighth notes, again summing to four beats.
4. The third measure contains **A>A e/d/c/B/**, where `A>A` is a dotted quarter note (three eighths) and `e/d/c/B/` is a group of four sixteenth notes (two eighths), summing to four beats.

From this analysis, the melody consistently groups into measures of **four beats**, suggesting the time signature is **4/4** (common time).
