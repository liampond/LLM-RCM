1. **Key of the melody**: The key is **A major**, as indicated by the key signature (`K:A`) and the presence of accidentals (e.g., `^d` and `^e`).

2. **Time signature**: The melody suggests a **6/8 time signature**, as the rhythms in each bar group into two beats of three eighth notes (compound duple meter).

3. **Chord symbol for bar 1**: The notes `f`, `c`, `A`, `B`, and `C` suggest an **F major chord** (F-A-C) with a passing tone (`B`). The implied chord is **F major**.

4. **Chord symbol for bar 2**: The notes `d`, `B`, `f`, and `e` suggest a **B minor chord** (B-D-F#) with a passing tone (`e`). The implied chord is **B minor**.

5. **Chord symbol for bar 3**: The notes `c`, `^d`, `^e`, `g`, `f`, and `e` suggest a **G major chord** (G-B-D) with chromatic passing tones (`^d` and `^e`). The implied chord is **G major**.

6. **Chord symbol for bar 4**: The note `f` is repeated, and no other notes are present. This suggests an **F major chord** (F as the root). The implied chord is **F major**.
