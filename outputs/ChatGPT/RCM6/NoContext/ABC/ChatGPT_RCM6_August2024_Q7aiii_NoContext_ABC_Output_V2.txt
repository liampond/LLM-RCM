### Key of the Melody:
The key signature is **G major** (or its relative minor, E minor), as indicated by the key signature "K:G" in the ABC notation. However, the presence of the accidental **^D** (D-sharp) in the second measure suggests the melody is in **E minor**, as D-sharp is the leading tone in E minor.

### Time Signature:
The time signature is not explicitly stated ("M:?"), so it must be inferred. Examining the rhythm:

- Measure 1: **z GABcA** (1/16 notes) = 1/16 (rest) + 4/16 (notes) = **5/16 total**.
- Measure 2: **BGFE^DA** (1/16 notes) = 6/16 (notes).
- Measure 3: **G/F/Ee2 z2** = 3/16 (notes) + 2/16 (dotted half note) + 2/16 (rest) = **7/16 total**.
- Measure 4: **^d/^c/Ba2 z2** = 3/16 (notes) + 2/16 (dotted half note) + 2/16 (rest) = **7/16 total**.

The irregular grouping of rhythms suggests the melody is in **free time** rather than adhering to a strict time signature.
