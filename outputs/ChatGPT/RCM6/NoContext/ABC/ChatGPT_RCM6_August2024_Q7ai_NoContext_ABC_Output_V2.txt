### Key of the Melody:
The key signature is **G major** (or its relative minor, E minor), as indicated by `K:G`. However, the melody prominently features accidentals such as **G♭** and **B♭**, which suggest chromaticism or modal mixture. The consistent use of these accidentals implies the melody may be in **G minor** or a chromatic variant of G major.

### Time Signature:
The rhythm of the melody is encoded in sixteenth notes (`L:1/16`). Examining the note groupings:

- The first measure contains **gbf gbd gbf gbd**, which are four groups of three sixteenth notes each. This totals **12 sixteenth notes**.
- The second measure contains **ecG g2c dBG g2**, which also totals **12 sixteenth notes** (with the `g2` representing a dotted eighth note, equivalent to three sixteenth notes).

This consistent grouping of 12 sixteenth notes per measure suggests the time signature is **12/16**.
