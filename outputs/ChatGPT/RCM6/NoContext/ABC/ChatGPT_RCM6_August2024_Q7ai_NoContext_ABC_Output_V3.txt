### Key of the Melody:
The key signature is **G major** (or its relative minor, E minor), as indicated by `K:G`. However, the melody prominently features accidentals such as **G♭** and **B♭**, which suggest chromaticism or modal mixture. The consistent use of these accidentals implies the melody may be in **G minor** or a chromatic variant of G major.

### Time Signature:
The rhythm of the melody is encoded in sixteenth notes (`L:1/16`). Examining the note groupings:

- The first measure contains **16 sixteenth notes** (4 groups of 4 sixteenth notes: `gbf gbd gbf gbd`).
- This suggests a **4/4 time signature**, as 16 sixteenth notes fill one measure in 4/4.

Thus:
- **Key:** G minor (likely, due to accidentals).
- **Time Signature:** 4/4.
