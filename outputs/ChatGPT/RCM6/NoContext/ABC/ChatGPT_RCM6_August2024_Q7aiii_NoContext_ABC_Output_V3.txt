### Key of the Melody:
The key signature is **G major** (one sharp, F#). However, the melody contains accidentals such as ^D (D#) and ^C (C#), which suggest a modulation or chromaticism. The presence of these accidentals could imply a temporary shift to **A major** or **E minor** (relative minor of G major), but without further context, the key is best identified as **G major**.

### Time Signature:
The melody is written in **L:1/16** (sixteenth-note units). Analyzing the rhythm:

- The first measure contains **GABcA** (5 sixteenth notes) and a rest (z), totaling **6 sixteenth notes**.
- The second measure contains **BGFE^DA** (6 sixteenth notes), totaling **6 sixteenth notes**.
- The third measure contains **G/F/Ee2** (1 sixteenth note, 1 sixteenth note, 1 sixteenth note, and a dotted eighth note, equivalent to 3 sixteenth notes) and a rest (z2, equivalent to 2 sixteenth notes), totaling **6 sixteenth notes**.
- The fourth measure contains **^d/^c/Ba2** (1 sixteenth note, 1 sixteenth note, 1 sixteenth note, and a dotted eighth note, equivalent to 3 sixteenth notes) and a rest (z2, equivalent to 2 sixteenth notes), totaling **6 sixteenth notes**.

Each measure consistently adds up to **6 sixteenth notes**, which suggests the time signature is **6/16**.
