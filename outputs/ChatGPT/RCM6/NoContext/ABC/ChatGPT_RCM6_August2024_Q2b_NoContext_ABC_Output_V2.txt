To determine the time signature for each measure, we analyze the rhythmic values of the notes in each bar. The unit of note length is defined as `L:1/16`, meaning each 16th note is one beat.

### Measure 1: `F6 F2 FFF2 F2F2`
- `F6`: 6/16 (dotted quarter note)
- `F2`: 2/16 (eighth note)
- `FFF2`: 3/16 (triplet eighth note group)
- `F2F2`: 4/16 (two eighth notes)

Adding these:
6/16 + 2/16 + 3/16 + 4/16 = **15/16**

### Measure 2: `FFF/F/ F>FF F2F`
- `FFF/F/`: 3/16 (triplet eighth note group)
- `F>FF`: 4/16 (dotted eighth note + sixteenth note)
- `F2F`: 4/16 (two eighth notes)

Adding these:
3/16 + 4/16 + 4/16 = **11/16**

### Conclusion:
- Measure 1 is in **15/16** time.
- Measure 2 is in **11/16** time.
