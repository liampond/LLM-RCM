To write the D-flat major scale in the bass clef, ascending and descending, follow these steps:

1. **Key Signature**: D-flat major has 5 flats: B♭, E♭, A♭, D♭, and G♭.
2. **Scale Notes**: The notes of the D-flat major scale are: D♭, E♭, F, G♭, A♭, B♭, C, and D♭ (ascending), and the reverse order for descending.

### Ascending:
- Write the notes in the bass clef staff as whole notes: D♭, E♭, F, G♭, A♭, B♭, C, D♭.
- Use the key signature to indicate the flats (B♭, E♭, A♭, D♭, G♭).

### Descending:
- Write the notes in reverse order as whole notes: D♭, C, B♭, A♭, G♭, F, E♭, D♭.
- The key signature remains the same.

Ensure the notes are spaced evenly and aligned properly on the staff.
