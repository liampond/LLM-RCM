To determine the time signature for each measure, we analyze the rhythmic values of the notes in each bar. The unit of note length is specified as `L:1/16`, meaning each note value is a sixteenth note.

### Measure 1: `F6 F2 FFF2 F2F2`
- `F6`: A dotted quarter note (6 sixteenth notes).
- `F2`: An eighth note (2 sixteenth notes).
- `FFF2`: A triplet eighth note (2 sixteenth notes).
- `F2F2`: Two eighth notes (4 sixteenth notes).

Adding these together:  
6 (F6) + 2 (F2) + 2 (FFF2) + 4 (F2F2) = **14 sixteenth notes**.

### Measure 2: `FFF/F/ F>FF F2F`
- `FFF/F/`: A triplet eighth note (2 sixteenth notes).
- `F>FF`: A quarter note with an accent (4 sixteenth notes).
- `F2F`: An eighth note followed by another eighth note (4 sixteenth notes).

Adding these together:  
2 (FFF/F/) + 4 (F>FF) + 4 (F2F) = **10 sixteenth notes**.

### Conclusion:
The measures do not conform to a consistent time signature. Measure 1 has 14 sixteenth notes, and Measure 2 has 10 sixteenth notes. This suggests the piece is written in free time (`M:none`), as indicated in the header.
