### Key of the Melody:
The key of the melody is **D-flat major**. This is indicated by the `K:Db` in the ABC notation.

### Time Signature:
The time signature is not explicitly provided (`M:?`), so we must infer it from the rhythms. The melody contains the following rhythms:

1. Bar 1: `dd ff` (two eighth notes + two eighth notes = 4 eighth notes)
2. Bar 2: `d2 AA` (one quarter note + two eighth notes = 4 eighth notes)
3. Bar 3: `A>A e/d/c/B/` (one dotted eighth note + four sixteenth notes = 4 eighth notes)
4. Bar 4: `A2` (one quarter note = 2 eighth notes, but this is likely a partial or incomplete bar).

From this, we can infer that the melody is in **2/4 time**, as each full bar (except the last, which appears incomplete) contains the equivalent of 4 eighth notes, consistent with 2/4 meter.
