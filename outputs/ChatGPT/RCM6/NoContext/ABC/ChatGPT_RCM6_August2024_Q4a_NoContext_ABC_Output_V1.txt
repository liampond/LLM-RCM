To transpose the melody up a **minor sixth**, we need to raise each note by that interval. The original key is **E major**, and transposing up a minor sixth moves the key to **C major** (E → C is a minor sixth). The new key signature will have **no sharps or flats**.

Here is the transposed melody:

```

 C8 E4 G4 | A6 BC A4 z4 | F8 E4 A4 | E4 D2ED C4 z4 || %4
```

### Explanation of the transposition:
1. **E → C** (key change to C major).
2. Each note is raised by a minor sixth:
   - E → C
   - G → E
   - B → G
   - D → B
   - F → D
   - A → F
   - c → A
   - e → C
3. Rhythms remain unchanged.

The new key is **C major**.
