To replace the placeholder rhythms (quarter notes with x-shaped noteheads) with appropriate rests, we must ensure that each measure adheres to the specified time signature. Let's analyze each measure step by step:

### Measure-by-measure analysis:
1. **Measure 1 (M:4/2)**:  
   - Notes: `F3 F2 F/`  
   - Durations: `F3` (dotted half note = 3 beats), `F2` (half note = 2 beats), `F/` (eighth note = 0.5 beats).  
   - Total duration: \( 3 + 2 + 0.5 = 5.5 \) beats.  
   - Missing duration: \( 8 - 5.5 = 2.5 \) beats.  
   - Solution: Add a **quarter rest (1 beat)** and a **dotted quarter rest (1.5 beats)** to complete the measure.

2. **Measure 2 (M:4/2)**:  
   - Notes: `(3FFF F2`  
   - Durations: `(3FFF` (triplet of eighth notes = 1 beat), `F2` (half note = 2 beats).  
   - Total duration: \( 1 + 2 = 3 \) beats.  
   - Missing duration: \( 8 - 3 = 5 \) beats.  
   - Solution: Add a **whole rest (4 beats)** and a **quarter rest (1 beat)** to complete the measure.

3. **Measure 3 (M:6/4)**:  
   - Notes: `F<F F2 F3`  
   - Durations: `F<F` (quarter note + eighth note = 1.5 beats), `F2` (half note = 2 beats), `F3` (dotted half note = 3 beats).  
   - Total duration: \( 1.5 + 2 + 3 = 6.5 \) beats.  
   - Missing duration: \( 6 - 6.5 = -0.5 \) beats.  
   - **Error**: This measure exceeds the time signature by 0.5 beats. The notation must be corrected to fit the 6/4 time signature.

4. **Measure 4 (M:6/4)**:  
   - Notes: `F2 F FF F2`  
   - Durations: `F2` (half note = 2 beats), `F` (quarter note = 1 beat), `FF` (two quarter notes = 2 beats), `F2` (half note = 2 beats).  
   - Total duration: \( 2 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 7 \) beats.  
   - **Error**: This measure exceeds the time signature by 1 beat. The notation must be corrected to fit the 6/4 time signature.

5. **Measure 5 (M:9/8)**:  
   - Notes: `F/FF/ F2`  
   - Durations: `F/FF/` (triplet of sixteenth notes = 0.75 beats), `F2` (dotted quarter note = 3 beats).  
   - Total duration: \( 0.75 + 3 = 3.75 \) beats.  
   - Missing duration: \( 9 - 3.75 = 5.25 \) beats.  
   - Solution: Add a **dotted half rest (4.5 beats)** and a **dotted eighth rest (0.75 beats)** to complete the measure.

6. **Measure 6 (M:9/8)**:  
   - Notes: `F/ F2 F F/F/F/F/F`  
   - Durations: `F/` (sixteenth note = 0.25 beats), `F2` (dotted quarter note = 3 beats), `F` (quarter note = 2 beats), `F/F/F/F/F` (five sixteenth notes = 1.25 beats).  
   - Total duration: \( 0.25 + 3 + 2 + 1.25 = 6.5 \) beats.  
   - Missing duration: \( 9 - 6.5 = 2.5 \) beats.  
   - Solution: Add a **dotted quarter rest (1.5 beats)** and a **quarter rest (1 beat)** to complete the measure.

7. **Measure 7 (M:3/4)**:  
   - Notes: `F2`  
   - Durations: `F2` (half note = 2 beats).  
   - Total duration: \( 2 \) beats.  
   - Missing duration: \( 3 - 2 = 1 \) beat.  
   - Solution: Add a **quarter rest (1 beat)** to complete the measure.

8. **Measure 8 (M:3/4)**:  
   - Notes: `F3/4 F2`  
   - Durations: `F3/4` (dotted eighth note = 0.75 beats), `F2` (half note = 2 beats).  
   - Total duration: \( 0.75 + 2 = 2.75 \) beats.  
   - Missing duration: \( 3 - 2.75 = 0.25 \) beats.  
   - Solution: Add a **sixteenth rest (0.25 beats)** to complete the measure.

### Summary of missing rests:
- Measure 1: **Quarter rest + dotted quarter rest**.  
- Measure 2: **Whole rest + quarter rest**.  
- Measure 3: **Error: Exceeds time signature**.  
- Measure 4: **Error: Exceeds time signature**.  
- Measure 5: **Dotted half rest + dotted eighth rest**.  
- Measure 6: **Dotted quarter rest + quarter rest**.  
- Measure 7: **Quarter rest**.  
- Measure 8: **Sixteenth rest**.
