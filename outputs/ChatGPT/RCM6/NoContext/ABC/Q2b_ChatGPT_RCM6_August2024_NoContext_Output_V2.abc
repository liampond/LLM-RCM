To infer the time signature, we analyze the rhythmic values in each measure.

### Measure 1: `F6 F2 FFF2 F2F2`
- `F6` = 6 sixteenth notes
- `F2` = 2 sixteenth notes
- `FFF2` = 3 sixteenth notes + 2 sixteenth notes = 5 sixteenth notes
- `F2F2` = 2 sixteenth notes + 2 sixteenth notes = 4 sixteenth notes
- Total = 6 + 2 + 5 + 4 = **17 sixteenth notes**

This does not fit a standard time signature. However, if the measure is incomplete or irregular, it could be part of a larger context.

### Measure 2: `FFF/F/ F>FF F2F`
- `FFF/F/` = 3 sixteenth notes (slurred)
- `F>FF` = 1 sixteenth note (accented) + 2 sixteenth notes = 3 sixteenth notes
- `F2F` = 2 sixteenth notes + 1 sixteenth note = 3 sixteenth notes
- Total = 3 + 3 + 3 = **9 sixteenth notes**

This suggests **9/16** as the time signature for this measure.

### Conclusion:
- Measure 1: Irregular or incomplete (17 sixteenth notes).
- Measure 2: Likely **9/16**.
