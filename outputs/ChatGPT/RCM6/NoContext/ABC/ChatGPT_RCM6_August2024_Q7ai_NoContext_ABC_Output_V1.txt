### Key of the Melody:
The key signature is **G major** (or its relative minor, E minor), as indicated by `K:G`. However, the melody prominently features accidentals such as **G♭** and **B♭**, which suggest chromaticism or modal mixture. The consistent use of these accidentals does not firmly establish G major or E minor, but the key signature remains G major.

### Time Signature:
The melody is written in **1/16 note units** (`L:1/16`). Analyzing the rhythm:

- The first measure contains **gbf gbd gbf gbd**, which are four groups of three 1/16 notes each. This totals **12 sixteenth notes**.
- The second measure contains **ecG g2c dBG g2**, which also totals **12 sixteenth notes** (the `g2` indicates a dotted eighth note, equivalent to 3 sixteenth notes).

Thus, each measure contains **12 sixteenth notes**, which corresponds to a **12/16 time signature**. This is a compound meter, often felt as 4 groups of triplets.
