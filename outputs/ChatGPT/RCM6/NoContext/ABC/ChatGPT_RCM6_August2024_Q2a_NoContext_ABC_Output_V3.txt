To replace the placeholder rhythms (quarter notes with x-shaped noteheads) with appropriate rests, we need to carefully examine the time signature of each measure and ensure the total rhythmic value in each bar matches the time signature.

### Measure-by-measure analysis:

1. **Measure 1 (M:4/2)**:  
   - The measure contains `F3 F2 F/`.  
   - `F3` = 3 beats, `F2` = 2 beats, `F/` = 1/8 beat.  
   - Total = 5 1/8 beats.  
   - To complete the 4/2 time signature (8 beats), we need **2 7/8 beats of rests**.  
   - Solution: Add a **half rest (2 beats)** and a **dotted quarter rest (3/8 beat)**.

2. **Measure 2 (M:4/2)**:  
   - The measure contains `(3FFF F2`.  
   - `(3FFF` = 1 beat (triplet eighth notes), `F2` = 2 beats.  
   - Total = 3 beats.  
   - To complete the 4/2 time signature (8 beats), we need **5 beats of rests**.  
   - Solution: Add a **whole rest (4 beats)** and a **quarter rest (1 beat)**.

3. **Measure 3 (M:6/4)**:  
   - The measure contains `F<F F2 F3`.  
   - `F<F` = 1 beat (eighth note + eighth note), `F2` = 2 beats, `F3` = 3 beats.  
   - Total = 6 beats.  
   - The measure is already complete, so no rests are needed.

4. **Measure 4 (M:6/4)**:  
   - The measure contains `F2 F FF F2`.  
   - `F2` = 2 beats, `F` = 1 beat, `FF` = 2 beats (assuming tied eighth notes), `F2` = 2 beats.  
   - Total = 7 beats.  
   - This exceeds the 6/4 time signature (6 beats). Likely an error in the encoding.

5. **Measure 5 (M:9/8)**:  
   - The measure contains `F/FF/ F2`.  
   - `F/FF/` = 3/8 beats (triplet sixteenth notes), `F2` = 6/8 beats.  
   - Total = 9/8 beats.  
   - The measure is already complete, so no rests are needed.

6. **Measure 6 (M:9/8)**:  
   - The measure contains `F/ F2 F F/F/F/F/F`.  
   - `F/` = 1/8 beat, `F2` = 6/8 beats, `F` = 1/8 beat, `F/F/F/F/F` = 5/8 beats.  
   - Total = 13/8 beats.  
   - This exceeds the 9/8 time signature (9 beats). Likely an error in the encoding.

7. **Measure 7 (M:3/4)**:  
   - The measure contains `F2`.  
   - `F2` = 2 beats.  
   - To complete the 3/4 time signature (3 beats), we need **1 beat of rests**.  
   - Solution: Add a **quarter rest (1 beat)**.

8. **Measure 8 (M:3/4)**:  
   - The measure contains `F3/4 F2`.  
   - `F3/4` = 3/4 beat, `F2` = 2 beats.  
   - Total = 2 3/4 beats.  
   - To complete the 3/4 time signature (3 beats), we need **1/4 beat of rests**.  
   - Solution: Add a **sixteenth rest (1/4 beat)**.

### Summary of rests to add:
- **Measure 1**: Add a **half rest** and a **dotted quarter rest**.  
- **Measure 2**: Add a **whole rest** and a **quarter rest**.  
- **Measure 3**: No rests needed.  
- **Measure 4**: Likely an error in the encoding (exceeds time signature).  
- **Measure 5**: No rests needed.  
- **Measure 6**: Likely an error in the encoding (exceeds time signature).  
- **Measure 7**: Add a **quarter rest**.  
- **Measure 8**: Add a **sixteenth rest**.
