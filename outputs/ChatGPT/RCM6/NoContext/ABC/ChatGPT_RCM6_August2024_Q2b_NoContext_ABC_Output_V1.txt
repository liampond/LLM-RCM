To determine the time signature for each measure, we analyze the rhythmic values of the notes in each bar. The unit of note length is defined as 1/16 (L:1/16), so each note's duration is measured in sixteenth notes.

### Measure 1: `F6 F2 FFF2 F2F2`
- `F6`: 6 sixteenth notes
- `F2`: 2 sixteenth notes
- `FFF2`: 3 sixteenth notes (F, F, F) + 2 sixteenth notes = 5 sixteenth notes
- `F2F2`: 2 sixteenth notes + 2 sixteenth notes = 4 sixteenth notes

Total: \( 6 + 2 + 5 + 4 = 17 \) sixteenth notes.

This does not correspond to a standard time signature, as it is an irregular measure.

### Measure 2: `FFF/F/ F>FF F2F`
- `FFF/F/`: The slashes indicate beaming, but the total duration is 3 sixteenth notes (F, F, F).
- `F>FF`: The `>` indicates an accent, but the duration is still 3 sixteenth notes (F, F, F).
- `F2F`: 2 sixteenth notes + 1 sixteenth note = 3 sixteenth notes.

Total: \( 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 \) sixteenth notes.

This also does not correspond to a standard time signature, as it is another irregular measure.

### Conclusion:
Both measures are irregular and do not fit into standard time signatures. Measure 1 has 17 sixteenth notes, and Measure 2 has 9 sixteenth notes. These could suggest the use of free rhythm or an unconventional meter.
