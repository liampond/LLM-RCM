KEY SIGNATURE ANALYSIS:
1. Looking at the key signature, I see one sharp (♯) at the beginning of the piece.
2. According to the key signature table:
   - 1 sharp corresponds to either G Major or E Minor
3. Looking for clues to determine if it's major or minor:
   - The piece uses F♯ consistently (part of the key signature)
   - The melody emphasizes G, B, and D (G major triad)
   - The piece begins and ends with notes from the G major scale
   - There are no accidentals suggesting E minor tonality
4. Conclusion: The piece is in G Major

TIME SIGNATURE ANALYSIS:
1. Analyzing the beat groupings:
   - The piece consistently groups notes in sets of three 16th notes
   - Each measure contains four groups of three 16th notes
   - In measure 2, we see some eighth notes, but they maintain the same total duration

2. Calculating the total value:
   - Each group of three 16th notes = 3/16
   - There are four such groups per measure
   - Total per measure = 12 sixteenth notes (4 groups × 3 sixteenth notes)

3. Determining the meter type:
   - The grouping of three 16th notes suggests compound time
   - Each group of three 16th notes forms one beat
   - Four such groups per measure indicates four main beats

4. Determining the time signature:
   - Since we have 12 sixteenth notes total
   - And they're grouped in fours (of three 16ths each)
   - This suggests 12/16 time signature

SUMMARY:
Key: G Major (1 sharp - F♯)
Time Signature: 12/16 (compound quadruple time)

The piece is written in G Major with one sharp (F♯) in the key signature. The time signature is 12/16, which creates a compound quadruple meter where each beat is divided into three parts, with four main beats per measure. This can be clearly seen in the consistent grouping of three sixteenth notes throughout the piece.", type='text')]
