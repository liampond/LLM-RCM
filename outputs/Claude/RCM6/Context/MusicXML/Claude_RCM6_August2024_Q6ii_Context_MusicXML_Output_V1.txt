[TextBlock(text="I'll help determine each element step by step.

1. Key of the melody:
- Looking at the key signature, there are 2 sharps (F♯ and C♯)
- Using the key signature table: 2 sharps corresponds to either D Major or B Minor
- The piece begins and ends on D-based chords
- There's no evidence of raised seventh degree for minor key
- Therefore, the key is D Major

2. Second last chord (measure 3):
- Notes from bottom to top: A2, E4, A4, C♯5
- Root is A (bass note)
- Has major third (C♯)
- Has perfect fifth (E)
- Root/quality chord symbol: A (A major)

3. Last chord (measure 4):
- Notes from bottom to top: F♯3, F♯4, A4, D5
- Root is D (based on context and resolution)
- Has major third (F♯)
- Has perfect fifth (A)
- Root/quality chord symbol: D (D major)

4. Functional chord symbols:
In D major:
- A major is built on scale degree 5 → V
- D major is built on scale degree 1 → I

5. Cadence type:
- Movement is from V → I
- Final chord is tonic (I)
- Therefore, this is an authentic cadence

Final answers:
- Key: D Major
- Second last chord root/quality: A
- Last chord root/quality: D
- Second last chord function: V
- Last chord function: I
- Cadence type: Authentic", type='text')]
