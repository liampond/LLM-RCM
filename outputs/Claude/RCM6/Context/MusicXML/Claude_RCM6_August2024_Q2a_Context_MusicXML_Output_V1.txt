Summary:
All x-headed quarter notes should be replaced with quarter rests. This maintains the proper beat groupings while respecting the hierarchy of strong and weak beats in each time signature. The quarter rest is the most appropriate choice in each case as it maintains clarity and readability while properly subdividing the measures according to their respective time signatures.", type='text')]
