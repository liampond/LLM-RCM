[TextBlock(text="Let me analyze each question:

1. Key of the piece:
Looking at the key signature, there is one flat (B♭). According to Guide 1, this indicates either F major or D minor. Based on the melodic content and the emphasis on F in both hands, this piece is in F major.

2. Time Signature:
Looking at the rhythmic groupings in each measure, we consistently see patterns of 6 eighth notes (3+3). This suggests 6/8 time, a compound duple meter.

3. First three eighth notes of bar 2:
The notes are F-B♭-D in both hands, outlining a subdominant triad (IV in F major).

4. Interval between last eighth note of bar 2 (C) and first note of bar 3 (E):
Following Guide 4, counting from C to E gives us a third. Since E is in C's major scale, this is a Major third.

5. Functional chord symbol for first three eighth notes of bar 5:
The notes outline F-A-C, which forms the tonic triad (I) in F major.

6. Last three eighth notes of bar 7:
The notes C-G-B♭ outline a dominant triad (V) in F major.

7. Interval between second and third eighth notes in bar 8 left hand (E to B♭):
Following Guide 4, counting from E to B♭ gives us a diminished fifth.

8. Rest needed at end of bar 8:
In 6/8 time, after a quarter note (2 eighth notes), we need an eighth rest to complete the measure.

9. Period type:
This is a parallel period because both four-bar phrases begin with similar melodic material (F-C-A-F pattern) but end with different cadences.

10. Allegretto vivace means:
A moderately fast (allegretto) and lively/spirited (vivace) tempo.

Summary:
This piece is a parallel period in F major, written in 6/8 time. It features clear harmonic progressions built on primary triads (I, IV, V) and demonstrates typical Classical period structure. The tempo marking suggests a bright, energetic performance style. The piece makes effective use of compound meter and shows careful attention to voice leading and harmonic progression.", type='text')]
