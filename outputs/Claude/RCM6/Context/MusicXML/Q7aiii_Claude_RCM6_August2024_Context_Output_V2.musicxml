[TextBlock(text='Let me analyze this step by step.

KEY SIGNATURE ANALYSIS:
1. Looking at the key signature at the beginning of the piece:
- There is 1 sharp (#) in the key signature
2. According to the table:
- 1 sharp corresponds to either G Major or E Minor
3. Additional analysis:
- The piece has a D# accidental appearing in measures 2 and 4
- The piece ends on an A note
- The melodic patterns and emphasis seem to center around G
4. Conclusion for key:
G Major is the most likely key, as the piece follows typical G major patterns and the D# appears as a chromatic passing tone rather than a structural note.

TIME SIGNATURE ANALYSIS:
Step 1: Analyzing beam groupings in measure 1:
- 16th rest (2 divisions)
- Five 16th notes beamed together (2 divisions each = 10 divisions)
Total for measure 1: 12 divisions

Step 2: Analyzing measure 2:
- Six 16th notes (2 divisions each = 12 divisions)
Total for measure 2: 12 divisions

Step 3: Analyzing measure 3:
- Two 32nd notes (1 division each = 2 divisions)
- One 16th note (2 divisions)
- One 8th note (4 divisions)
- One 8th rest (4 divisions)
Total for measure 3: 12 divisions

Step 4: Analyzing measure 4:
- Two 32nd notes (1 division each = 2 divisions)
- One 16th note (2 divisions)
- One 8th note (4 divisions)
- One 8th rest (4 divisions)
Total for measure 4: 12 divisions

Since each measure consistently contains 12 divisions, and the groupings suggest compound time (groups of three), this indicates a compound meter. With 12 divisions per measure and sixteenth notes being worth 2 divisions, this points to 6/8 time signature.

SUMMARY:
Key: G Major (1 sharp in key signature)
Time Signature: 6/8 (compound duple meter)
- Each measure contains 12 divisions
- Groupings suggest compound time
- The eighth note gets one beat, with six eighth notes per measure
- The rhythmic patterns and beaming clearly show the compound duple feel characteristic of 6/8 time
