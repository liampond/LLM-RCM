[TextBlock(text='Let me analyze the rhythms in the provided MusicXML file to determine the time signature.

Measure 1 contains:
- Dotted quarter note (3/8)
- Eighth note (1/8)
- Two sixteenth notes + eighth note (1/8 + 1/8)
- Two eighth notes (1/8 + 1/8)

Total value = 3/8 + 1/8 + 2/8 + 2/8 = 8/8 = 1 whole beat

Measure 2 contains:
- Two sixteenth notes + two thirty-second notes (2/8)
- Dotted sixteenth + thirty-second + sixteenth (2/8)
- Eighth + sixteenth (3/8)

Total value = 2/8 + 2/8 + 3/8 = 8/8 = 1 whole beat

Analysis:
1. Each measure contains exactly 8 eighth-note divisions
2. The beaming patterns suggest groupings of 2s and 3s
3. The total duration of each measure equals one whole note
4. The rhythmic subdivisions are primarily based on eighth notes

Therefore, the time signature must be 4/4 (common time):
- Top number 4: four beats per measure
- Bottom number 4: quarter note gets one beat
- This explains why each measure adds up to 8 eighth notes (equivalent to 4 quarter notes)

The rhythmic groupings and beaming patterns are consistent with 4/4 time, where each beat can be subdivided into smaller note values while maintaining the overall four-beat structure.

Final Answer: The time signature is 4/4', type='text')]
