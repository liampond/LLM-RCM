[TextBlock(text="I'll help determine each element step by step.

1. Key of the melody:
- Looking at the key signature, there are 3 flats (B♭, E♭, A♭)
- According to the key signature table, this could be E♭ major or C minor
- Looking at the melody and final cadence, it ends on G with B natural and D, suggesting C minor
Therefore, the key is C minor

2. Second last chord (measure 3, last beat):
- Notes from bottom to top: C3, G4, C5, E♭5
- Root is C
- Has minor third (E♭)
- This is a C minor chord
Therefore, the root/quality symbol is Cm

3. Last chord (measure 4):
- Notes from bottom to top: G2, G4, B♮4, D5
- Root is G
- Has major third (B natural)
- This is a G major chord
Therefore, the root/quality symbol is G

4. Functional symbols:
In C minor:
- Cm (second last chord) = i (tonic)
- G (last chord) = V (dominant)

5. Cadence type:
- Progression is from i to V
- Final chord is V (dominant)
- According to the guide, when a cadence ends on V, it's a half cadence

Therefore:
- Key: C minor
- Second last chord root/quality: Cm
- Last chord root/quality: G
- Second last chord function: i
- Last chord function: V
- Cadence type: Half cadence", type='text')]
