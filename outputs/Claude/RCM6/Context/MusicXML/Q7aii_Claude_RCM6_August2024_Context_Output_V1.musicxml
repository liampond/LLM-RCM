KEY SIGNATURE ANALYSIS:
1. Looking at the key signature, I see 5 flats
2. Consulting the table in the guide:
   5 flats corresponds to either D♭ Major or B♭ Minor
3. Looking at the melodic content:
   - The piece starts and ends on A♭
   - The melody emphasizes A♭, D♭, and F
   - No raised seventh degree is prominently featured
4. Conclusion: The key is D♭ Major

TIME SIGNATURE ANALYSIS:
Step 1: Identify Beat Groupings
Measure 0: One eighth note (pickup)
Measure 1: Two pairs of eighth notes (2+2)
Measure 2: One quarter note + two eighth notes (2+2)
Measure 3: Dotted eighth + sixteenth + four sixteenth notes (3+1+4)
Measure 4: One quarter note (2)

Step 2: Check Total Values
- Each eighth note = 0.5 beats
- Each quarter note = 1 beat
- The groupings suggest simple time (not compound)
- Beat unit appears to be quarter note (4 as bottom number)

Step 3: Count Total Beats Per Measure
Measure 1: 4 eighth notes = 2 beats
Measure 2: 1 quarter + 2 eighth notes = 2 beats
Measure 3: (dotted eighth + sixteenth) + (4 sixteenths) = 2 beats
Measure 4: 1 quarter note = 1 beat (final measure)

Step 4: Determine Time Signature
- Each full measure contains 2 beats
- Beat unit is quarter note
- Therefore, time signature is 2/4

SUMMARY:
Key: D♭ Major (5 flats)
Time Signature: 2/4
The piece is a short melody in simple duple meter, with a pickup measure, written in D♭ Major. The rhythmic patterns consistently group into two beats per measure, using a mixture of eighth notes, sixteenth notes, and quarter notes.
