[TextBlock(text="I'll analyze each measure of the provided MusicXML file to determine the intervals between the two notes in each measure.

Measure 1: A4 to G5
Step 1: Notes are A and G
Step 2: Count: A(1), B(2), C(3), D(4), E(5), F(6), G(7)
Step 3: Using A major scale (A,B,C♯,D,E,F♯,G♯), G is one semitone lower than G♯
Final Answer: Minor seventh

Measure 2: F♯4 to B♭4
Step 1: Notes are F♯ and B♭
Step 2: Count: F(1), G(2), A(3), B(4)
Step 3: Using F♯ major scale (F♯,G♯,A♯,B,C♯,D♯,E♯), B♭ is two semitones lower than B
Final Answer: Diminished fourth

Measure 3: E4 to C♯5
Step 1: Notes are E and C♯
Step 2: Count: E(1), F(2), G(3), A(4), B(5), C(6)
Step 3: Using E major scale (E,F♯,G♯,A,B,C♯,D♯), C♯ matches the major scale
Final Answer: Major sixth

Measure 4: C♭5 to D5
Step 1: Notes are C♭ and D
Step 2: Count: C(1), D(2)
Step 3: Using C♭ major scale (C♭,D♭,E♭,F♭,G♭,A♭,B♭), D is two semitones higher than D♭
Final Answer: Augmented second

Measure 5: B4 to F♯5
Step 1: Notes are B and F♯
Step 2: Count: B(1), C(2), D(3), E(4), F(5)
Step 3: Using B major scale (B,C♯,D♯,E,F♯,G♯,A♯), F♯ matches the major scale
Final Answer: Perfect fifth", type='text')]
