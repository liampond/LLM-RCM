[TextBlock(text="Let me analyze this step by step.

KEY SIGNATURE ANALYSIS:
1. Looking at the key signature, I see one sharp (♯).
2. According to the key signature table:
   - 1 sharp corresponds to either G Major or E Minor
3. Looking for clues to determine major vs minor:
   - The piece prominently features G, B, and D notes (G major triad)
   - The F notes are consistently sharp (F♯)
   - The piece has a strong emphasis on G as a central tone
   - There's no raised seventh degree that would suggest E minor
4. Conclusion: The piece is in G Major

TIME SIGNATURE ANALYSIS:
Step 1: Identify Beat Groupings
- The notes are consistently grouped in sets of three 16th notes
- Each measure contains four groups of three 16th notes
- Measure 2 has some variation but maintains the same total duration

Step 2: Check Total Value of Beam Groupings
- Each group of three 16th notes equals 0.75 beats
- This indicates compound time (groupings of three)
- The smallest note value is a 16th note

Step 3: Count Total Beats
- Each measure contains 12 sixteenth notes
- These are grouped as 4 sets of 3 sixteenth notes
- In compound time, this suggests 4 main beats, each divided into three parts

Step 4: Determine Time Signature
- The grouping of 12 sixteenth notes into 4 main beats indicates 12/16 time
- However, since these are clearly grouped into four main beats with triplet subdivisions, this is more commonly notated as 4/4 with triplet subdivisions
- The beaming pattern confirms this interpretation

SUMMARY:
Key: G Major (1 sharp)
Time Signature: 4/4 (Common Time)
The piece is written with consistent triplet subdivisions throughout, creating a flowing, compound feel within a simple quadruple meter framework.", type='text')]
