KEY SIGNATURE ANALYSIS:
1. Looking at the key signature, I see 5 flats
2. Consulting the table in the guide:
   - 5 flats corresponds to either D♭ Major or B♭ Minor
3. Looking for clues to determine major vs minor:
   - The piece starts and ends on A♭
   - The melody emphasizes A♭ and uses notes from the B♭ minor scale
   - The overall melodic contour suggests B♭ minor
Therefore, the key is B♭ minor (5 flats: B♭, E♭, A♭, D♭, G♭)

TIME SIGNATURE ANALYSIS:
Let's analyze measure by measure:

Measure 0 (pickup):
- One eighth note (0.5 beats)

Measure 1:
- Four eighth notes (2 beats total)
- Grouped as (2 eighths) + (2 eighths)

Measure 2:
- One quarter note (1 beat)
- Two eighth notes (1 beat)
- Total: 2 beats

Measure 3:
- Dotted eighth + sixteenth (1 beat)
- Four sixteenth notes (1 beat)
- Total: 2 beats

Measure 4:
- One quarter note (1 beat)
- This is the final measure, so it completes the pickup measure

Analysis:
1. Each full measure contains 2 beats
2. The beat unit is a quarter note (as evidenced by the groupings)
3. The pickup measure plus the final measure make one complete measure
4. The consistent grouping of eighth notes in pairs suggests simple time

Therefore, the time signature is 2/4 (two quarter notes per measure)

SUMMARY:
Key: B♭ minor (5 flats)
Time Signature: 2/4
This is a piece in simple duple time in the key of B♭ minor. The presence of a pickup measure (anacrusis) and the consistent two-beat groupings throughout confirm the 2/4 time signature.", type='text')]
