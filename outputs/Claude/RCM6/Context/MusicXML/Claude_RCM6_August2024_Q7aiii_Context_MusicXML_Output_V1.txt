[TextBlock(text="Let me analyze this step by step.

KEY SIGNATURE ANALYSIS:
1. Looking at the key signature at the beginning of the piece:
- There is one sharp (#) in the key signature
- According to the table, one sharp corresponds to either:
  * G Major
  * E Minor

2. Additional Analysis:
- Looking at accidentals: There are two notable accidentals:
  * D# appears in measures 2 and 4
  * C# appears in measure 4
- The piece ends with a rest after an A note
- The melodic patterns seem to center around G
- There's no consistent use of F# as a leading tone to G

3. Conclusion for Key:
Based on these observations, the piece appears to be in G Major rather than E Minor.

TIME SIGNATURE ANALYSIS:
1. Analyzing the beat groupings in measure 1:
- Sixteenth rest (1/16)
- Five sixteenth notes beamed together (5/16)
Total for measure 1 = 6/16

2. Measure 2:
- Six sixteenth notes beamed together (6/16)
Total for measure 2 = 6/16

3. Measure 3:
- Two 32nd notes (2/32 = 1/16)
- One sixteenth note (1/16)
- One eighth note (2/16)
- One eighth rest (2/16)
Total for measure 3 = 6/16

4. Measure 4:
- Two 32nd notes (2/32 = 1/16)
- One sixteenth note (1/16)
- One eighth note (2/16)
- One eighth rest (2/16)
Total for measure 4 = 6/16

5. Time Signature Determination:
- Each measure consistently contains 6 sixteenth notes worth of time
- The grouping suggests compound meter (groups of three)
- Since the basic unit is a sixteenth note, and there are 6 of them, this indicates a 6/16 time signature

SUMMARY:
Key: G Major (one sharp in key signature)
Time Signature: 6/16 (compound duple meter with sixteenth note as the basic unit)

The piece is written in G Major with a 6/16 time signature, featuring intricate sixteenth and thirty-second note patterns that create a flowing, compound meter feel.", type='text')]
