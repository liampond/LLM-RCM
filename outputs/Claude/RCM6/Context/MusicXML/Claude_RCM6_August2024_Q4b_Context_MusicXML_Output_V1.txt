[TextBlock(text="Let me help determine the interval of transposition and then transpose the melody.

First, let's identify the original and new keys:
- Original key: E major (4 sharps)
- New key: A♭ major (4 flats)

To find the interval of transposition:
Starting from E, counting up to A♭:
E (1), F (2), G (3), A♭ (4)
The interval is a fourth.

Since A♭ is a semitone lower than what would be in the E major scale (where the fourth would be A♯), this makes it a Perfect fourth.

The interval of transposition is a Perfect fourth up.

Here's the transposed melody, measure by measure:

Measure 1:
- E → A♭
- G♯ → C
- B → E♭

Measure 2:
- D♯ → G
- E → A♭
- F♯ → B♭
- E → A♭
- Quarter rest remains a rest

Measure 3:
- C♯ → F
- B → E♭
- E → A♭

Measure 4:
- B → E♭
- A → D♭
- G♯ → C
- A → D♭
- G♯ → C
- Quarter rest remains a rest

The new key signature should have 4 flats (B♭, E♭, A♭, D♭), and all rhythms remain exactly the same as in the original.", type='text')]
