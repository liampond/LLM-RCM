[TextBlock(text='Let me analyze each question:

1. Key of the piece:
Looking at the key signature, there is one flat (B♭). According to Guide 1, this indicates either F major or D minor. Based on the melodic content and the emphasis on F in both hands, this piece is in F major.

2. Time signature:
Looking at the beam groupings and note values, each measure contains:
- 6 eighth notes total
- Grouped in threes (3+3)
This suggests 6/8 time signature.

3. First three eighth notes of bar 2:
Notes are F-B♭-D (in both hands)
In F major, these notes form the subdominant triad (IV).

4. Interval between last eighth note of bar 2 (C) and first note of bar 3 (E):
Following Guide 4:
C to E = Major third

5. First three eighth notes of bar 5:
Notes are F-A-C
In F major, this forms the tonic triad (I)

6. Last three eighth notes of bar 7:
Notes are G-B♭-C
In F major, this forms the dominant triad (V)

7. Interval between second and third eighth notes in bar 8 left hand (E to B♭):
Following Guide 4:
E to B♭ = Diminished fifth

8. Rest needed at end of bar 8:
In 6/8 time, after a quarter note (2 eighth notes), we need an eighth rest to complete the measure.

9. Period type:
This is a parallel period because:
- Both phrases begin with similar material
- First phrase ends with a weaker cadence
- Second phrase ends with a stronger cadence

10. Allegretto vivace means:
A moderately fast (allegretto) and lively/spirited (vivace) tempo.

Summary:
This piece is in F major, written in 6/8 time. It follows a parallel period structure with clear harmonic progressions using primary triads (I, IV, V). The piece demonstrates typical Classical-era characteristics with its balanced phrases and clear cadential points. The tempo marking suggests a bright, energetic performance style.
