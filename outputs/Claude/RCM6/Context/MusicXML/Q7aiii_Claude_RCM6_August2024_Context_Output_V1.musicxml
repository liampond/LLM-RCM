KEY SIGNATURE ANALYSIS:
1. Looking at the key signature, I see one sharp (♯).
2. According to the key signature table:
   - 1 sharp corresponds to either G Major or E Minor
3. Looking for clues to determine major vs minor:
   - The piece has a D♯ accidental in measures 2 and 4
   - The melody frequently emphasizes G and B
   - The piece has a strong focus on G as a central tone
4. Conclusion: The piece is in G Major

TIME SIGNATURE ANALYSIS:
Step 1: Analyzing beam groupings in measure 1:
- Sixteenth rest (0.25)
- Five sixteenth notes beamed together (5 × 0.25 = 1.25)
Total for measure 1 = 1.5 beats

Step 2: Analyzing measure 2:
- Six sixteenth notes beamed together (6 × 0.25 = 1.5)
Total for measure 2 = 1.5 beats

Step 3: Analyzing measure 3:
- Two 32nd notes (2 × 0.125 = 0.25)
- One sixteenth note (0.25)
- One eighth note (0.5)
- One eighth rest (0.5)
Total for measure 3 = 1.5 beats

Step 4: Analyzing measure 4:
- Two 32nd notes (2 × 0.125 = 0.25)
- One sixteenth note (0.25)
- One eighth note (0.5)
- One eighth rest (0.5)
Total for measure 4 = 1.5 beats

Since each measure consistently contains 1.5 beats, and the smallest subdivision is a 32nd note, this suggests a compound meter. The total value of 1.5 beats per measure indicates 3/16 time signature, where:
- Top number (3) represents three sixteenth notes per measure
- Bottom number (16) represents the sixteenth note as the basic unit

SUMMARY:
Key: G Major (1 sharp in key signature)
Time Signature: 3/16 (compound meter with three sixteenth notes per measure)

The piece is a quick, light composition in G Major with a lively compound meter that creates a flowing, dance-like feel through its consistent grouping of three sixteenth notes per measure.
