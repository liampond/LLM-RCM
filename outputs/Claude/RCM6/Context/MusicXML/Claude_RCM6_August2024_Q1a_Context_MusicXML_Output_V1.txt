Measure 2:
Notes: F♯4 and B♭4
Step 1: Lower note F♯, upper note B♭
Step 2: Count: F(1), G(2), A(3), B(4)
Step 3: In F♯ major scale (F♯,G♯,A♯,B,C♯,D♯,E♯), B♭ is two semitones lower than B
Final interval: Diminished fourth

Measure 3:
Notes: E4 and C♯5
Step 1: Lower note E, upper note C♯
Step 2: Count: E(1), F(2), G(3), A(4), B(5), C(6)

Final interval: Major sixth

Measure 4:
Notes: C♭5 and D5
Step 1: Lower note C♭, upper note D
Step 2: Count: C(1), D(2)
Step 3: In C♭ major scale (C♭,D♭,E♭,F♭,G♭,A♭,B♭), D natural is two semitones higher than D♭
Final interval: Augmented second
