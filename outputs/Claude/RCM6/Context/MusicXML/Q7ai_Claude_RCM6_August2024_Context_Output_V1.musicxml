KEY SIGNATURE ANALYSIS:
1. Looking at the key signature, I see one sharp (♯).
2. Using the key signature table:
   - 1 sharp corresponds to either G Major or E Minor
3. Looking for clues to determine major vs minor:
   - The piece prominently features G, B, and D notes (G major triad)
   - The F notes are consistently sharp (F♯)
   - The melodic patterns center around G
   - No raised seventh degree typical of minor keys is present
4. Conclusion: The piece is in G Major

TIME SIGNATURE ANALYSIS:
Step 1: Identify Beat Groupings
- The notes are consistently grouped in sets of three 16th notes
- Each measure contains four groups of three 16th notes (in measure 1)
- Measure 2 has a slightly different pattern but maintains the same total duration

Step 2: Check Total Value of Beam Groupings
- Each group of three 16th notes equals 0.75 beats
- This indicates compound time (groupings of three)
- The smallest note value is a 16th note

Step 3: Count Total Beats
- Measure 1 has 12 sixteenth notes (4 groups of 3)
- Measure 2 maintains the same total duration
- The pattern suggests 12 sixteenth notes per measure

Step 4: Determine Time Signature
- Since we have groups of three 16th notes
- Total of 12 sixteenth notes per measure
- The time signature would be 12/16

SUMMARY:
Key: G Major (1 sharp)
Time Signature: 12/16 (compound quadruple meter)
This piece is written in G Major with one sharp (F♯) in the key signature. The time signature is 12/16, which creates a compound quadruple feel with four main beats per measure, each divided into three sixteenth notes. The melodic content strongly centers around the G major triad (G-B-D), confirming the G major tonality.
