[TextBlock(text="I'll analyze each measure of the given ABC file, determining the interval between the two notes in each chord.

Measure 1: [Ag]
Lower note: A
Upper note: g
Count: A(1), B(2), C(3), D(4), E(5), F(6), G(7)
Using A major scale (A, B, C♯, D, E, F♯, G♯)
G natural is one semitone lower than G♯
Result: Minor seventh

Measure 2: [F_B]
Lower note: F
Upper note: B♭
Count: F(1), G(2), A(3), B(4)
Using F major scale (F, G, A, B♭, C, D, E)
B♭ matches the major scale
Result: Perfect fourth

Measure 3: [Ec]
Lower note: E
Upper note: c
Count: E(1), F(2), G(3), A(4), B(5), C(6)
Using E major scale (E, F♯, G♯, A, B, C♯, D♯)
C natural is one semitone lower than C♯
Result: Minor sixth

Measure 4: [_cd]
Lower note: C♭
Upper note: d
Count: C(1), D(2)
Using C♭ major scale (C♭, D♭, E♭, F♭, G♭, A♭, B♭)
D natural is two semitones higher than D♭
Result: Augmented second

Measure 5: [Bf]
Lower note: B
Upper note: f
Count: B(1), C(2), D(3), E(4), F(5)
Using B major scale (B, C♯, D♯, E, F♯, G♯, A♯)
F natural is one semitone lower than F♯
Result: Diminished fifth", type='text')]
