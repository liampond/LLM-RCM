[TextBlock(text="Let me analyze this step by step.

KEY SIGNATURE ANALYSIS:
1. Looking at the key signature (K:G), we see one sharp (F#).
2. According to the key signature table, one sharp corresponds to:
   - G Major or E Minor
3. Looking for raised seventh degree and other clues:
   - The piece starts and ends with notes centered around G
   - There are no consistent raised seventh degrees that would indicate E minor
   - The melodic content emphasizes G as the tonal center
Therefore, the piece is in G Major.

TIME SIGNATURE ANALYSIS:
Step 1: Identify Beat Groupings
Looking at the beamed notes in each measure:
Measure 1: z GABcA (6 sixteenth notes)
Measure 2: BGFE^DA (6 sixteenth notes)
Measure 3: G/F/Ee2 z2 (equivalent to 6 sixteenth notes)
Measure 4: ^d/^c/Ba2 z2 (equivalent to 6 sixteenth notes)

Step 2: Check Total Value
- Each measure consistently contains 6 sixteenth notes
- The grouping of 6 sixteenth notes suggests compound meter
- Since we're working with sixteenth notes (L:1/16), the bottom number will be 16

Step 3: Count Total Beats
- Each measure contains 6 sixteenth notes
- In compound meter, this typically divides into two groups of three
- The top number will be 6

Step 4: Write Time Signature
The time signature is 6/16
This represents a compound duple meter, with two main beats per measure, each divided into three sixteenth notes.

SUMMARY:
Key: G Major (one sharp)
Time Signature: 6/16 (compound duple meter)
The piece is written in G Major with one sharp (F#) in the key signature. The consistent grouping of six sixteenth notes per measure indicates a 6/16 time signature, which creates a lilting, compound duple feel with two main beats per measure, each subdivided into three sixteenth notes.", type='text')]
