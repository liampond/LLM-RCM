3. Chord in bar 2 (first three eighth notes):

4. Interval between last note of bar 2 (C) and first note of bar 3 (E):
From C to E is a Major third.

5. Functional chord symbol in bar 5 (first three eighth notes):

6. Chord in bar 7 (last three eighth notes):
Notes G, B form part of a G major triad (dominant chord).

7. Interval between second and third eighth notes in left hand of bar 8:
From E to B is a Perfect fifth.

8. Rest needed at end of bar 8:
In 6/8 time, after the F, an eighth rest is needed to complete the measure.

9. Period type:
This is a parallel period because the consequent phrase begins with the same melodic material as the antecedent phrase.

10. Allegretto vivace meaning:
This tempo marking means "fairly quick and lively." Allegretto indicates a moderately fast tempo (slightly slower than allegro), while vivace adds a bright, spirited character to the performance.
