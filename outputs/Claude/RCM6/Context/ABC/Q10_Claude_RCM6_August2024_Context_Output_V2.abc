[TextBlock(text='Let me analyze each question:

1. Key of the piece:
Looking at the key signature (one flat - Bâ™­), and analyzing the melodic content and cadences, this piece is in F Major.

2. Time Signature:
Analyzing the beam groupings and total beats per measure, this is 3/4 time (three quarter notes per measure).

3. Chord in bar 2 (first three eighth notes):
Notes are F,B,D - this forms a supertonic triad (G minor triad in second inversion).

4. Interval between last note of bar 2 (C) and first note of bar 3 (E):
From C to E is a Major third.

5. Functional chord symbol in bar 5 (first three eighth notes):
The notes outline an F major triad (F,A,C) - this is the tonic chord (I).

6. Chord in bar 7 (last three eighth notes):
Notes are C,G,B - this forms the dominant triad (G major).

7. Interval between second and third eighth notes in left hand of bar 8:
From E to B is a Perfect fifth.

8. Rest needed at end of bar 8:
Based on the 3/4 time signature and the notes present, an eighth rest is needed to complete the measure.

9. Period type:
This is a parallel period because the consequent phrase begins with the same melodic material as the antecedent phrase.

10. Allegretto vivace meaning:
This tempo marking means "fairly quick and lively" - faster than allegretto but not as fast as vivace alone.

Summary:
This is an F Major piece in 3/4 time, structured as a parallel period. It features clear harmonic progressions using primary triads (I, IV, V) and secondary triads (ii, vi). The tempo marking indicates a brisk, energetic performance style. The piece demonstrates traditional Classical period phrase structure with balanced antecedent and consequent phrases.
