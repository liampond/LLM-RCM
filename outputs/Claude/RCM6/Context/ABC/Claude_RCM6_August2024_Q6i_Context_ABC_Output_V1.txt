[TextBlock(text="Let me analyze this step by step.

1. Key of the melody:
- Looking at the key signature (K:Eb), there are 3 flats
- According to the key signature table, 3 flats indicates Eb major or C minor
- Looking at the melodic content and final cadence, this piece is in Eb major

2. Second last chord [Gce]:
- Root: G (bass note is C but the chord structure suggests G is the root)
- Quality: Looking at the notes G, C, E
- This forms a C major triad
- Root/quality chord symbol: C

3. Last chord [GBd]:
- Root: G (bass note is G)
- Notes present: G, B (natural), D
- This forms a G major triad
- Root/quality chord symbol: G

4. Functional analysis:
- In Eb major:
  - C major is VI (built on scale degree 6)
  - G major is III (built on scale degree 3)
- Second last chord functional symbol: VI
- Last chord functional symbol: III

5. Cadence type:
Since neither the final chord is V or I in Eb major, this appears to be an unusual cadence that doesn't fit the typical authentic or half cadence patterns. However, given the choices, and considering G (III) functions similarly to V in this context, this would be classified as a half cadence.

Final answers:
- Key: Eb major
- Second last chord root/quality: C
- Last chord root/quality: G
- Second last chord function: VI
- Last chord function: III
- Cadence type: Half cadence", type='text')]
