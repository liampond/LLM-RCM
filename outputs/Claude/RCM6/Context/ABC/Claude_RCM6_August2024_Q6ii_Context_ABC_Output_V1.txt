[TextBlock(text="Let me analyze this step by step.

1. Key of the melody:
- Looking at the key signature (K:D), there are 2 sharps (F# and C#)
- This indicates either D major or B minor
- The piece begins and ends with D-based harmonies
- Therefore, the key is D major

2. Second last chord [EAc]:
- Bass note is A (in bass clef)
- Notes from bottom to top: E, A, C (natural)
- Root is A
- With C natural (not C#), this creates a minor third above A
- This is an A minor chord
Root/quality symbol: Am

3. Last chord [FAd]:
- Bass note is F
- Notes from bottom to top: F, A, D
- Root is F
- Major third above F (A)
Root/quality symbol: F

4. Functional chord symbols (Roman numerals in D major):
- Am is built on scale degree 5 but is minor: v
- F is built on scale degree 3: ♭III

5. Cadence type:
Since neither the second-last chord (v) nor the last chord (♭III) is V or I, this appears to be a non-standard cadence that doesn't fit the typical authentic or half cadence patterns. This progression is somewhat modal or jazz-influenced rather than following traditional functional harmony.

To summarize:
- Key: D major
- Second last chord root/quality: Am
- Last chord root/quality: F
- Second last chord function: v
- Last chord function: ♭III
- Cadence type: Non-standard (neither authentic nor half)", type='text')]
