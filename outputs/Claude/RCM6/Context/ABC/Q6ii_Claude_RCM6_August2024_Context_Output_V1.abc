[TextBlock(text='Let me analyze this step by step.

1. Key of the melody:
- Looking at the key signature (K:D), the piece is in D major
- This is confirmed by the two sharps (F# and C#) in the key signature

2. Second last chord [EAc]:
- Bass note is A (in bass clef)
- Notes from bottom to top: A, E, A, C
- With A as root, and C (not C#), this is an A minor chord
Root/quality symbol: Am

3. Last chord [FAd]:
- Bass note is F
- Notes from bottom to top: F, A, D
- With F as root, and A (not Ab), this is an F major chord
Root/quality symbol: F

4. Functional symbols (Roman numerals in D major):
- Am is built on scale degree 5 down a step to scale degree 4
Therefore Am = v (but functions as iv in major key)
- F is built on scale degree 3
Therefore F = ♭III

5. Cadence type:
Since neither the second last chord (iv) nor the last chord (♭III) is V or I, this is not a standard authentic or half cadence. This appears to be a deceptive or irregular cadence.

Therefore:
- Key: D major
- Second last chord root/quality: Am
- Last chord root/quality: F
- Second last chord function: iv
- Last chord function: ♭III
- Cadence type: Neither authentic nor half (irregular/deceptive)
