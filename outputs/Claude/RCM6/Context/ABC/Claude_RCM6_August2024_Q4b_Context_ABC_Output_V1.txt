[TextBlock(text='Let me help you transpose this melody from E major to A♭ major.

First, let\'s find the interval of transposition:
- Starting note: E
- Target note: A♭
- Counting up: E(1), F(2), G(3), A(4)
- Since A♭ is a semitone lower than A, and we\'re going up from E to A♭, this is a Minor fourth.

So we need to transpose each note up by a minor fourth. Here\'s the transposed version:

X:1
T:RCM6_August2024_Q4 (Transposed to A♭)
L:1/16
M:4/4
K:Ab
V:1 treble nm="Piano" snm="Pno."
V:1
A♭8 B4 d4 | G6 A♭B♭ A♭4 z4 | e♭8 d4 g4 | d4 c2B♭c B♭4 z4 ||

The interval of transposition is a Minor fourth upward.

I\'ve maintained all the original rhythms while shifting each note up by a minor fourth:
- E → A♭
- G → B
- B → D
- D → G
- C → E♭
- B → D
- E → A♭
- A → C
- G → B♭

All rhythmic values remain exactly as in the original.', type='text')]
