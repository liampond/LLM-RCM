[TextBlock(text="I'll analyze each measure according to the time signatures and beat patterns to determine the appropriate rests.

Measure 1 (4/2 time):
- Has F3 (3 beats), F2 (2 beats), and F/ (0.5 beats)
- Total duration = 5.5 beats out of 8 beats needed
- Need 2.5 beats to complete the measure
- Solution: Add a half rest (2 beats) followed by a quarter rest (0.5 beats)

Measure 2 (4/2 time):
- Has triplet FFF (1 beat) and F2 (2 beats)
- Total duration = 3 beats out of 8 beats needed
- Need 5 beats to complete the measure
- Solution: Add a whole rest plus a quarter rest (5 beats total)

Measure 3 (6/4 time):
- Has F<F F2 F3
- Total duration = 6 beats, measure is complete
- No rests needed

Measure 4 (6/4 time):
- Has F2 F FF F2
- Total duration = 6 beats, measure is complete
- No rests needed

Measure 5 (9/8 time):
- Has F/FF/ F2
- Total duration = 4 eighth notes out of 9 needed
- Need 5 eighth notes worth of rests
- Solution: Add a dotted quarter rest (3 eighth notes) plus an eighth rest (1 eighth note) plus another eighth rest

Measure 6 (9/8 time):
- Has F/ F2 F F/F/F/F/F
- Total duration = 9 eighth notes
- Measure is complete, no rests needed

Measure 7 (3/4 time):
- Has F2 (2 beats)
- Need 1 beat to complete
- Solution: Add a quarter rest

Measure 8 (3/4 time):
- Has F3/4 F2
- Total duration = 2.75 beats
- Need 0.25 beats to complete
- Solution: Add a sixteenth rest

Summary:
The piece changes time signatures several times (4/2 → 6/4 → 9/8 → 3/4) and requires careful attention to beat groupings and rest combinations. The rests were placed according to the beat hierarchy principles while maintaining proper beat divisions within each time signature.", type='text')]
