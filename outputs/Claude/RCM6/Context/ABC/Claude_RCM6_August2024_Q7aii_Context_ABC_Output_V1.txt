TIME SIGNATURE ANALYSIS:
Let's analyze each measure:

Measure 1:
- Single eighth note pickup (A)

Measure 2:
- dd ff (four eighth notes)
- Total value = 4 eighth notes = 2 beats

Measure 3:
- d2 AA (one quarter note + two eighth notes)
- Total value = 4 eighth notes = 2 beats

Measure 4:
- A>A e/d/c/B/ (dotted eighth + sixteenth + four sixteenth notes)
- Total value = 4 eighth notes = 2 beats

Measure 5:
- A2 (one quarter note)
- Total value = 2 eighth notes = 1 beat (final measure)

Analysis:
1. Each full measure contains 4 eighth notes (equivalent to 2 quarter notes)
2. The beat groupings suggest simple time
3. The eighth notes are grouped in pairs, suggesting quarter note beats
4. Each complete measure has 2 beats
5. Quarter notes represent one beat, so the bottom number should be 4

Conclusion for Time Signature: 2/4 time

SUMMARY:
- Key: D-flat major (5 flats)
- Time Signature: 2/4 (simple duple time)
