[TextBlock(text="Let me analyze this step by step.

KEY SIGNATURE ANALYSIS:
1. Looking at the key signature (K:G), there is one sharp (F♯).
2. According to the key signature table, one sharp corresponds to:
   - G Major or E Minor
3. Looking at the melodic content:
   - The piece uses notes G, B, D prominently (G major triad)
   - The piece begins and ends with notes from G major chord
   - There are no accidentals suggesting minor tonality
4. Conclusion: The piece is in G Major

TIME SIGNATURE ANALYSIS:
1. Analyzing the rhythmic groupings:
   First measure: gbf gbd gbf gbd
   - Each group (gbf, gbd) consists of three 16th notes
   - There are 4 such groups = 12 sixteenth notes total

2. Second measure: ecG g2c dBG g2
   - Similar pattern, equivalent to 12 sixteenth notes

3. Determining the beat structure:
   - Each group of three 16th notes forms one beat
   - Four groups per measure = four beats
   - The grouping of three 16th notes suggests compound meter
   - Each beat divides into three parts (16th notes)

4. Bottom number:
   - Since we're counting in 16th notes, the bottom number is 16

5. Top number:
   - 12 sixteenth notes per measure
   - Therefore, the top number is 12

SUMMARY:
Key: G Major (one sharp - F♯)
Time Signature: 12/16 (compound quadruple meter)
- Each measure contains 12 sixteenth notes
- Grouped as four beats, each divided into three 16th notes
- The consistent grouping of three 16th notes and four main beats per measure clearly indicates 12/16 time", type='text')]
