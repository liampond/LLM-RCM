[TextBlock(text='Let me analyze this step by step.

KEY SIGNATURE ANALYSIS:
1. Looking at the key signature (K:G), we see one sharp (F#)
2. According to the key signature table:
   - One sharp corresponds to either G Major or E Minor
3. Looking for other clues:
   - The piece starts and ends with notes centered around G
   - There are no consistent raised seventh degrees that would indicate E minor
   - The melodic content emphasizes G major tonality
Therefore, the piece is in G Major.

TIME SIGNATURE ANALYSIS:
Step 1: Identify Beat Groupings
Looking at the beamed notes in each measure:
Measure 1: z GABcA (6 sixteenth notes)
Measure 2: BGFE^DA (6 sixteenth notes)
Measure 3: G/F/Ee2 z2 (6 sixteenth notes)
Measure 4: ^d/^c/Ba2 z2 (6 sixteenth notes)

Step 2: Check Total Value of Beam Groupings
- Each measure consistently contains 6 sixteenth notes
- The grouping of 6 sixteenth notes suggests compound meter
- Each group of 3 sixteenth notes forms one beat

Step 3: Determine Bottom Number
- The basic unit is a sixteenth note
- Therefore, the bottom number is 16

Step 4: Count Total Beats
- Each measure has 6 sixteenth notes
- In compound meter, this represents 2 main beats (each divided into 3)
- Therefore, the top number is 6

The time signature is 6/16.

SUMMARY:
Key: G Major (one sharp - F#)
Time Signature: 6/16 (compound duple meter, with two main beats per measure, each divided into three sixteenth notes)
