[TextBlock(text="I'll help transpose this melody up a minor sixth and provide the new key and notes.

A minor sixth up from E takes us to C, so the new key will be C major.

Here's the melody transposed up a minor sixth, maintaining the exact same rhythms:

Original: E8 G4 B4 | D6 EF E4 z4 | c8 B4 e4 | B4 A2GA G4 z4 ||

Transposed (up minor 6th):
C8 E4 G4 | B6 CD C4 z4 | a8 G4 c4 | G4 F2EF E4 z4 ||

The new key signature would be C major (no sharps or flats).

To write this in ABC notation:

X:1
M:4/4
L:1/16
K:C
C8 E4 G4 | B6 CD C4 z4 | a8 G4 c4 | G4 F2EF E4 z4 ||

Each note has been moved up by a minor sixth while preserving the original rhythmic values (eighth notes, sixteenth notes, etc.) and rests.", type='text')]
