[TextBlock(text='Let me analyze this step by step.

KEY SIGNATURE ANALYSIS:
1. Looking at K:Db in the ABC notation
2. This indicates 5 flats (B♭, E♭, A♭, D♭, G♭)
3. According to the key signature table:
   5 flats corresponds to D♭ Major or B♭ Minor
4. Looking at the melodic content:
   - The piece starts and ends with notes centered around D♭
   - No raised seventh degree is apparent
   - The melody emphasizes D♭ major tonality
Therefore, the piece is in D♭ Major.

TIME SIGNATURE ANALYSIS:
Let\'s analyze each measure:

Measure 1: Single note A (pickup measure)
- Value: 1 eighth note

Measure 2: "dd ff"
- Four eighth notes (d d f f)
- Total value: 4 eighth notes = 2 beats

Measure 3: "d2 AA"
- One quarter note (d2) = 2 eighth notes
- Two eighth notes (A A)
- Total value: 4 eighth notes = 2 beats

Measure 4: "A>A e/d/c/B/"
- Dotted eighth note (A>)
- Eighth note (A)
- Four sixteenth notes (e/d/c/B/)
- Total value: 4 eighth notes = 2 beats

Measure 5: "A2"
- One quarter note (A2)
- Total value: 2 eighth notes = 1 beat

Following the guide:
1. Each full measure contains 4 eighth notes (2 beats)
2. The beat unit is a quarter note (bottom number will be 4)
3. There are 2 beats per full measure
Therefore, the time signature is 2/4

SUMMARY:
Key: D♭ Major (5 flats)
Time Signature: 2/4 (simple duple meter)
The piece begins with a pickup (anacrusis) of one eighth note and consists of four measures in 2/4 time.
