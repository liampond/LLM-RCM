KEY SIGNATURE ANALYSIS:
1. Looking at the key signature (K:G), there is one sharp (F♯).
2. According to the key signature table:
   - One sharp corresponds to either G Major or E Minor
3. Looking at the melodic content:
   - The piece uses notes G, B, D prominently (G major triad)
   - No raised seventh degree typical of minor keys is present
   - The melodic patterns center around G major chord tones
4. Conclusion: The piece is in G Major

TIME SIGNATURE ANALYSIS:
1. Analyzing the beam groupings:
   First measure: "gbf gbd gbf gbd"
   - Four groups of three 16th notes each (gbf, gbd, gbf, gbd)
   - Each group = 3/16
   - Total in measure = 12/16

2. Second measure: "ecG g2c dBG g2"
   - Similar rhythmic grouping
   - The "g2" indicates a longer note value (eighth note)
   - This measure also totals 12/16

3. Determining the bottom number:
   - The smallest consistent subdivision is 16th notes
   - Therefore, bottom number is 16

4. Counting total beats:
   - Each measure contains 12 sixteenth notes
   - Therefore, top number is 12

5. The time signature is 12/16
   - This is compound quadruple meter
   - Four main beats per measure, each divided into three

SUMMARY:
Key: G Major (one sharp - F♯)
Time Signature: 12/16 (compound quadruple meter)
The piece is written in G Major with one sharp in the key signature. The rhythmic structure shows consistent groupings of three sixteenth notes, creating a compound meter with four main beats per measure, each divided into three parts, resulting in a 12/16 time signature.
