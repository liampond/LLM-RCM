[TextBlock(text='Let me analyze this step by step.

KEY SIGNATURE ANALYSIS:
1. Looking at the key signature (K:G), there is one sharp (F♯).
2. According to the key signature table:
   - One sharp corresponds to either G Major or E Minor
3. Looking at the melodic content:
   - The piece uses notes G, B, D prominently (G major triad)
   - No raised seventh degree typical of minor keys is present
   - The melodic patterns center around G major chord tones
4. Conclusion: The piece is in G Major

TIME SIGNATURE ANALYSIS:
1. Examining note values and groupings:
   - The piece starts with a sixteenth note pickup (d)
   - First measure: gbf gbd gbf gbd
   - Second measure: ecG g2c dBG g2
   
2. Analyzing beam groupings:
   - Each group (gbf) contains three 16th notes
   - Each measure contains four such groups
   - Total per measure = 12 sixteenth notes

3. Determining bottom number:
   - The smallest rhythmic value is a sixteenth note
   - Notes are grouped in threes, suggesting compound time
   - Bottom number should be 16

4. Counting total beats:
   - 12 sixteenth notes per measure
   - In compound time, this suggests 4 groups of 3
   - Top number should be 12

5. Therefore, the time signature is 12/16
   - This represents compound quadruple time
   - Each beat divides into three sixteenth notes
   - Four main beats per measure

SUMMARY:
Key: G Major (one sharp - F♯)
Time Signature: 12/16 (compound quadruple time)
The piece features a consistent rhythmic pattern of four groups of three sixteenth notes per measure, characteristic of 12/16 time, and clearly establishes G Major through its melodic content and key signature.', type='text')]
