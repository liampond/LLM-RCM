[TextBlock(text="Let me analyze this step by step.

KEY SIGNATURE ANALYSIS:
1. Looking at the key signature (K:G), there is one sharp (F♯) indicated.
2. According to the key signature table:
   - One sharp corresponds to either G Major or E Minor
3. Looking for clues to determine if it's major or minor:
   - The piece starts and ends with notes centered around G
   - The F♯ is part of the key signature (not an accidental)
   - The melodic movement and resolution points toward G
4. Conclusion: The piece is in G Major

TIME SIGNATURE ANALYSIS:
1. Looking at the rhythmic groupings:
   First measure: z GABcA (6 sixteenth notes)
   Second measure: BGFE^DA (6 sixteenth notes)
   Third measure: G/F/Ee2 z2 (6 sixteenth notes)
   Fourth measure: ^d/^c/Ba2 z2 (6 sixteenth notes)

2. Analyzing the beat groupings:
   - Each measure consistently contains 6 sixteenth notes
   - The rhythm is written in L:1/16 (sixteenth notes as the unit)
   - The groupings suggest 2 main beats per measure, each divided into 3

3. Determining the meter type:
   - Since each group of 3 sixteenth notes makes one beat
   - And there are 2 such groups per measure
   - This indicates compound duple meter

4. Calculating the time signature:
   - Bottom number: 8 (since each beat is divided into 3 sixteenth notes)
   - Top number: 6 (total number of sixteenth notes per measure)

SUMMARY:
Key: G Major (one sharp - F♯)
Time Signature: 6/8 (compound duple meter)
- Each measure contains 6 sixteenth notes
- Grouped as 2 beats of 3 sixteenth notes each
- The piece maintains this rhythmic structure consistently throughout all measures", type='text')]
