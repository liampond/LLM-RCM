[TextBlock(text="Let me analyze this step by step.

1. Key of the melody:
- Looking at the key signature (K:D), the piece is in D major
- This is confirmed by the two sharps (F# and C#) in the key signature

2. Second last chord [EAc]:
- Bass note is A
- Notes from bottom to top: A, E, C
- This forms an A minor chord (root A, minor third C, fifth E)
Root/quality symbol: Am

3. Last chord [FAd]:
- Bass note is F
- Notes from bottom to top: F, A, D
- This forms an F major chord (root F, major third A, fifth D)
Root/quality symbol: F

4. Functional chord symbols (Roman numerals in D major):
- Am is built on scale degree 5 of D major, but it's minor instead of major
- So second last chord is v (lowercase because it's minor)
- F is built on scale degree 3 of D major
- So last chord is ♭III (uppercase because it's major, flat because it's lowered)

5. Cadence type:
Since neither the second last chord (v) nor the last chord (♭III) is V or I, this is an irregular cadence and doesn't qualify as either an authentic or half cadence.

To summarize:
- Key: D major
- Second last chord root/quality: Am
- Last chord root/quality: F
- Second last chord function: v
- Last chord function: ♭III
- Cadence type: Neither authentic nor half (irregular)", type='text')]
