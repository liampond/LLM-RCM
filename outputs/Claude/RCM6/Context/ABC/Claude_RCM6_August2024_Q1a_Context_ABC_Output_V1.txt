[TextBlock(text="I'll analyze each measure of the given music, determining the interval between the two notes in each chord.

Measure 1: [A,g]
Step 1: Notes are A and g
Step 2: Count: A(1) B(2) C(3) D(4) E(5) F(6) G(7)
Step 3: Using A major scale (A B C♯ D E F♯ G♯), G natural is one semitone lower than G♯
Final Answer: Minor seventh

Measure 2: [F,B♭]
Step 1: Notes are F and B♭
Step 2: Count: F(1) G(2) A(3) B(4)
Step 3: Using F major scale (F G A B♭ C D E), B♭ matches the scale
Final Answer: Perfect fourth

Measure 3: [E,c]
Step 1: Notes are E and c
Step 2: Count: E(1) F(2) G(3) A(4) B(5) C(6)
Step 3: Using E major scale (E F♯ G♯ A B C♯ D♯), C natural is one semitone lower than C♯
Final Answer: Minor sixth

Measure 4: [c,d♭]
Step 1: Notes are c and d♭
Step 2: Count: C(1) D(2)
Step 3: Using C major scale (C D E F G A B), D♭ is one semitone lower than D
Final Answer: Minor second

Measure 5: [B,f]
Step 1: Notes are B and f
Step 2: Count: B(1) C(2) D(3) E(4) F(5)
Step 3: Using B major scale (B C♯ D♯ E F♯ G♯ A♯), F natural is one semitone lower than F♯
Final Answer: Diminished fifth", type='text')]
