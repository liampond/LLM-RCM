[TextBlock(text="I'll help transpose this melody up a minor sixth (8 semitones) and provide the new key and notes.

Original key: E major (4 sharps: F#, C#, G#, D#)
New key: C major (no sharps or flats) - up a minor sixth from E takes us to C

Here's the transposed melody with the same rhythms:

Original -> Transposed
E -> C (half note)
G# -> E (quarter note)
B -> G (quarter note)

D# -> B (dotted quarter note)
E -> C (sixteenth note)
F# -> D (sixteenth note)
E -> C (quarter note)
rest -> rest (quarter note)

C# -> A (half note)
B -> G (quarter note)
E -> C (quarter note)

B -> G (quarter note)
A -> F (eighth note)
G# -> E (sixteenth note)
A -> F (sixteenth note)
G# -> E (quarter note)
rest -> rest (quarter note)

The time signature remains 4/4 and all rhythmic values stay exactly the same as the original. The new key signature would be C major (no sharps or flats).", type='text')]
