[TextBlock(text="Let me analyze this step by step.

1. Determining the Key:
- The key signature has 2 sharps (F# and C#)
- According to the key signature table, this could be D major or B minor
- Looking at the melodic content and final resolution, the piece appears to be in D major

2. Second Last Chord (measure 3):
Root/Quality Analysis:
- Bass note: AA (A)
- Notes from bottom to top: A, E, A, C#
- Has a major third (A to C#)
- Forms A major triad
Root/Quality Chord Symbol: A

3. Last Chord (measure 4):
Root/Quality Analysis:
- Bass note: F#
- Notes from bottom to top: F#, A, D
- Forms a major triad with root F#
Root/Quality Chord Symbol: F#

4. Functional Analysis (in D major):
- Second Last Chord (A): V
- Last Chord (F#): III

5. Cadence Type:
Since the progression moves from V to III (rather than V to I), and neither ends on V or I, this appears to be a deceptive cadence, which wasn't one of the options. Between the two options given (authentic or half), neither accurately describes this cadence since it doesn't end on either I or V.

Final Answers:
- Key: D major
- Second Last Chord Root/Quality: A
- Last Chord Root/Quality: F#
- Second Last Chord Function: V
- Last Chord Function: III
- Cadence Type: Neither authentic nor half (it's deceptive)", type='text')]
