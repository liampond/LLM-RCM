[TextBlock(text='Let me analyze this step by step.

1. Key Determination:
- Key signature has 3 flats (B♭, E♭, A♭)
- Looking at the table, this indicates either E♭ major or C minor
- The melody emphasizes G and C, and uses Bn (raised leading tone)
- Therefore, the key is C minor

2. Second Last Chord:
- Bass note is C
- Notes from bottom to top: C, G, C, E♭
- This forms a C minor triad
Root/quality chord symbol: Cm

3. Last Chord:
- Bass note is G
- Notes from bottom to top: G, B, D
- This forms a G major triad
Root/quality chord symbol: G

4. Functional Analysis:
- In C minor:
  - Cm is the tonic chord = i
  - G is the dominant chord = V

5. Cadence Type:
- The progression moves from i to V
- The final chord is V (dominant)
- Therefore, this is a half cadence

Final Answer:
- Key: C minor
- Second Last Chord (root/quality): Cm
- Last Chord (root/quality): G
- Second Last Chord (functional): i
- Last Chord (functional): V
- Cadence Type: Half cadence', type='text')]
