KEY SIGNATURE ANALYSIS:
1. Looking at the key signature (*k[f#]), there is one sharp (F#)
2. According to the key signature table:
   - One sharp could indicate either G Major or E Minor
3. Looking for clues:
   - The piece uses F# consistently
   - The melody emphasizes G (many G notes, including gg)
   - The melodic pattern seems to center around G
   - No raised seventh degree typical of minor keys is present
4. Conclusion: The piece is in G Major

TIME SIGNATURE ANALYSIS:
Step 1: Identify Beat Groupings
- First measure: Single 16th note pickup (16dd)
- Second measure: Four groups of three 16th notes each (16ggLL 16bb 16ff#JJ) Ã— 4
- Third measure: Two groups of three 16th notes (16eeLL 16cc 16gJJ), followed by dotted eighth and 16th (8ggL 16ccJk), then another group of three 16ths (16ddLL 16b 16gJJ), and ending with an eighth note (8gg)

Step 2: Check Total Value of Beam Groupings
- Each group of three 16th notes = 0.75 beats
- The pattern suggests compound meter (groups of three)
- The smallest beat unit is a 16th note

Step 3: Count Total Beats
- Measure 2: Four groups of three 16ths = 12 sixteenth notes
- Measure 3: Two groups of three 16ths (6) + dotted eighth and 16th (3) + three 16ths (3) + eighth (2) = 14 sixteenth notes
- The consistent grouping of three 16th notes suggests 12/16 time

Step 4: Determine Time Signature
- The regular grouping of three 16th notes and the total count of 12 sixteenth notes per complete measure indicates 12/16 time signature

SUMMARY:
Key: G Major (one sharp - F#)
Time Signature: 12/16 (compound quadruple meter)
The piece begins with a sixteenth note pickup and consists of consistent groupings of three sixteenth notes, characteristic of compound meter. The melodic content and key signature clearly establish G Major as the key.', type='text')]
