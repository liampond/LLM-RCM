KEY SIGNATURE ANALYSIS:
1. Looking at the key signature, I see one sharp (f#)
2. According to the table, one sharp could indicate either:
   - G Major
   - E Minor
3. Looking for clues:
   - The piece contains a d#, which is the raised 7th degree in E minor
   - This d# appears as an accidental, not in the key signature
   - This strongly suggests E minor as the key

TIME SIGNATURE ANALYSIS:
Step 1: Identify Beat Groupings
Measure 1: 16r + (16,16,16,16,16) = 6 sixteenth notes
Measure 2: (16,16,16,16,16,16) = 6 sixteenth notes
Measure 3: (32,32,16) + 8 + 8 = 6 sixteenth notes
Measure 4: (32,32,16) + 8 + 8 = 6 sixteenth notes

Step 2: Check Total Value
- Each measure consistently contains 6 sixteenth notes
- The grouping of 6 sixteenth notes suggests compound meter
- Since we're counting in sixteenth notes, the bottom number will be 16

Step 3: Count Total Beats
- Each measure contains 6 sixteenth notes
- In compound meter, this typically divides into two groups of three
- The top number will be 6

Step 4: Write Time Signature
Based on the analysis, the time signature is 6/16

SUMMARY:
Key: E minor (one sharp in key signature, presence of raised 7th degree D#)
Time Signature: 6/16 (compound duple meter, with six sixteenth notes per measure)", type='text')]
