1. Key of the piece:
Looking at the key signature with one flat (B♭), and analyzing the melodic content and cadences, this piece is in F Major.

2. Time Signature:
Looking at the beam groupings of three eighth notes consistently throughout, and counting 6 eighth notes per measure, this indicates 6/8 time.

3. First three eighth notes of bar 2:
In F Major, the notes F-B♭-D outline the subdominant triad (IV).

4. Interval between last eighth note of bar 2 (C) and first note of bar 3 (E):
From C to E is a Major third.

5. Functional chord symbol for first three eighth notes of bar 5:

7. Interval between second and third eighth notes in left hand of bar 8:

8. Rest needed at end of bar 8:
In 6/8 time, after the quarter note F and eighth note rest shown, an eighth rest is needed to complete the measure.

9. Period type:
This is a parallel period because the opening material in bars 1-4 returns similarly in bars 5-8, with different endings.

10. Allegretto vivace meaning:
