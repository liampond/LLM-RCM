[TextBlock(text="I'll analyze each measure according to the time signatures and provide appropriate rests following the given methodology.

Measure 1 (4/2):
- Given: 4.f (dotted quarter), 4f (quarter), 16f (sixteenth)
- Need to complete the measure to total 8 beats (4/2 time)
- After the dotted quarter (1.5 beats), quarter (1 beat), and sixteenth (0.25 beats), we need 5.25 beats
Solution: Add a dotted whole rest (6 beats minus 0.75 = 5.25 beats)

Measure 2 (4/2):
- Given: Three eighth notes in triplet (1 beat), 4f (quarter)
- Need 6 beats more
Solution: Add a double whole rest (breve rest)

Measure 3 (6/4):
- Given: 16fKL 8.fJ (sixteenth + dotted eighth), 4f (quarter), 4.f (dotted quarter)
- Need to complete 6 beats
Solution: Add a half rest (2 beats)

Measure 4 (6/4):
- Given: 4f (quarter), 8f (eighth), two eighths, 4f (quarter)
- Need 3 beats
Solution: Add a dotted half rest

Measure 5 (9/8):
- Given: 16fKL 8f 16fJk (sixteenth + eighth + sixteenth), 4f (quarter)
- Need to complete 9 eighth notes worth
Solution: Add a dotted quarter rest

Measure 6 (9/8):
- Complex rhythm given
- Need minimal completion
Solution: Add an eighth rest

Measure 7 (3/4):
- Given: 4f (quarter)
- Need 2 beats
Solution: Add a half rest

Measure 8 (3/4):
- Given: 16.f (dotted sixteenth), 4f (quarter)
- Need to complete measure
Solution: Add a dotted half rest minus dotted sixteenth

Summary:
The measures required careful attention to beat groupings and hierarchies, especially in compound meters like 9/8. The solutions prioritize using larger rest values where possible while respecting beat strengths and metric groupings.", type='text')]
