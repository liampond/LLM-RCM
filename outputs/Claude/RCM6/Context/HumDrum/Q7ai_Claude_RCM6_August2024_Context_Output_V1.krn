KEY SIGNATURE ANALYSIS:
1. Looking at the key signature: k[f#] indicates one sharp (F#)
2. According to the key signature table:
   - One sharp could indicate either G Major or E Minor
3. Looking for clues:
   - The piece uses notes: dd, gg, bb, ff#, ee, cc, b, g
   - The melody emphasizes G and centers around G
   - No raised seventh degree of E minor (D#) is present
   - The piece appears to resolve to G
Therefore, the key is G Major.

TIME SIGNATURE ANALYSIS:
Step 1: Identify Beat Groupings
First measure after pickup:
- Three groups of 16th notes (16ggLL 16bb 16ff#JJ)
- Three groups of 16th notes (16ggLL 16bb 16ddJJ)
Each group contains three 16th notes

Second measure:
- One group of three 16th notes (16eeLL 16cc 16gJJ)
- Eighth note followed by 16th note (8ggL 16ccJk)
- One group of three 16th notes (16ddLL 16b 16gJJ)
- One eighth note (8gg)

Step 2: Analyze Beat Values
- Each group of three 16th notes = 0.75 beats
- The pattern of three 16th notes suggests compound meter
- The smallest beat unit is a 16th note

Step 3: Count Total Beats
First full measure:
- 6 groups of 3 sixteenth notes = 18 sixteenth notes
Second measure:
- 3 sixteenth notes + 3 sixteenth notes (eighth + sixteenth) + 3 sixteenth notes + 3 sixteenth notes (eighth note) = 12 sixteenth notes

Step 4: Determine Time Signature
- The grouping of three 16th notes suggests compound meter
- Each measure contains 18 sixteenth notes
- This equals 6 groups of 3 sixteenth notes
Therefore, the time signature is 18/16

SUMMARY:
Key: G Major (one sharp - F#)
Time Signature: 18/16 (compound meter with six beats per measure, each beat divided into three 16th notes)
