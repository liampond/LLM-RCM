KEY SIGNATURE ANALYSIS:
1. Looking at the key signature: [b-e-a-d-g-]
- There are 5 flats: B♭, E♭, A♭, D♭, G♭
2. Using the key signature table:
- 5 flats corresponds to D♭ Major or B♭ Minor
3. Additional analysis:
- The piece begins and ends on A♭
- No raised seventh degree is apparent
- The melodic content centers around A♭
- The piece uses notes from the D♭ major scale
Therefore, the key is D♭ Major

TIME SIGNATURE ANALYSIS:
Step 1: Identify Beat Groupings
Measure 1: 8a- (single eighth note)
Measure 2: 8dd-L 8dd-J 8ffL 8ffJ (four eighth notes paired in twos)
Measure 3: 4dd- 8a-L 8a-J (one quarter note + two eighth notes)
Measure 4: 8.a-L 16a-Jk 16ee-LL 16dd- 16cc 16b-JJ (dotted eighth + sixteenth + four sixteenths)
Measure 5: 4a- (one quarter note)

Step 2: Analyze Beat Patterns
- The consistent grouping of eighth notes in pairs suggests simple meter
- Each group of two eighth notes equals one beat
- Quarter notes appear regularly as single beats
- The bottom number would be 4 (quarter note gets the beat)

Step 3: Count Total Beats Per Measure
Measure 1: 1/2 beat (pickup measure)
Measure 2: 2 beats (four eighth notes = 2 beats)
Measure 3: 2 beats (quarter note + two eighth notes)
Measure 4: 2 beats (dotted eighth + sixteenth + four sixteenths = 2 beats)
Measure 5: 1 beat (final measure)

Step 4: Determine Time Signature
- Regular pattern of 2 beats per measure
- Quarter note gets the beat
Therefore, the time signature is 2/4

SUMMARY:
Key: D♭ Major (5 flats: B♭, E♭, A♭, D♭, G♭)
Time Signature: 2/4 (simple duple meter, quarter note gets the beat)

The piece begins with a pickup measure of one eighth note and maintains a consistent two-beat pattern throughout, with a mixture of eighth notes, quarter notes, and sixteenth notes, all fitting within the 2/4 framework.', type='text')]
