TIME SIGNATURE ANALYSIS:
Step 1: Identify Beat Groupings
Measure 1: 8a- (one eighth note)
Measure 2: 8dd-L 8dd-J 8ffL 8ffJ (four eighth notes paired in twos)
Measure 3: 4dd- 8a-L 8a-J (one quarter note + two eighth notes)
Measure 4: 8.a-L 16a-Jk 16ee-LL 16dd- 16cc 16b-JJ (dotted eighth + sixteenth + four sixteenths)
Measure 5: 4a- (one quarter note)

Step 2: Analyze Beat Patterns
- Each measure (except the pickup and final measure) contains 4 beats worth of eighth notes
- The beaming suggests groupings of two eighth notes per beat
- The rhythmic values add up to 4 beats per full measure

Step 3: Determine Meter Type
- The grouping of eighth notes in pairs suggests simple meter
- Each beat can be divided into two equal parts
- Quarter note gets one beat

Step 4: Final Time Signature
The time signature is 4/4 (Common Time)
- 4 beats per measure
- Quarter note gets one beat

SUMMARY:
Key: D♭ Major (5 flats: B♭, E♭, A♭, D♭, G♭)
