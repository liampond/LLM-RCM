[TextBlock(text="I'll analyze each measure of the provided music, determining the interval between the two notes in each measure. I'll follow the step-by-step process for each.

Measure 1: A to G♯
- Count: A(1), B(2), C(3), D(4), E(5), F(6), G(7)
- In A major scale: G♯ is one semitone higher than G natural
- Result: Major seventh

Measure 2: F♯ to B♭
- Count: F(1), G(2), A(3), B(4)
- In F♯ major scale: B natural would be the fourth, B♭ is lowered
- Result: Diminished fourth

Measure 3: E to C♯
- Count: E(1), F(2), G(3), A(4), B(5), C(6)
- In E major scale: C♯ is the sixth
- Result: Major sixth

Measure 4: C♭ to D
- Count: C(1), D(2)
- In C♭ major scale: D is raised from D♭
- Result: Augmented second

Measure 5: B to F♯
- Count: B(1), C(2), D(3), E(4), F(5)
- In B major scale: F♯ is the fifth
- Result: Perfect fifth", type='text')]
