KEY SIGNATURE ANALYSIS:
1. Looking at the key signature, I see one sharp (f#)
2. According to the table, one sharp could indicate either:
   - G Major
   - E Minor
3. Looking for clues:
   - The piece contains a d#, which is the raised 7th degree in E minor
   - This d# appears as an accidental, not in the key signature
   - This strongly suggests E minor as the key

TIME SIGNATURE ANALYSIS:
Step 1: Identify Beat Groupings
Measure 1: 16r + (16g,16a,16b,16cc,16a) = 6 sixteenth notes
Measure 2: (16b,16g,16f#,16e,16d#,16a) = 6 sixteenth notes
Measure 3: (32g,32f#,16e,8ee,8r) = 6 sixteenth notes
Measure 4: (32d#,32c#,16b,8aa,8r) = 6 sixteenth notes

Step 2: Check Total Value
- Each measure consistently contains 6 sixteenth notes
- The grouping of 6 sixteenth notes suggests compound meter
- In compound meter, groups of 3 sixteenth notes make one beat
- Therefore, each measure contains 2 beats

Step 3: Determine Bottom Number
- The smallest subdivision is thirty-second notes
- However, the primary grouping is in sixteenth notes
- This suggests 16 as the bottom number

Step 4: Write Time Signature
- With 6 sixteenth notes per measure
- The time signature must be 6/16

SUMMARY:
Key: E minor (one sharp in key signature, presence of raised 7th - D#)
Time Signature: 6/16 (compound duple meter, with six sixteenth notes per measure grouped into two beats of three sixteenth notes each)
