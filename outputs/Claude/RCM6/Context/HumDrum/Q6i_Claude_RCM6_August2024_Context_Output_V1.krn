[TextBlock(text='Let me analyze this step by step.

1. Key of the melody:
- Key signature shows 3 flats (B♭, E♭, A♭)
- Looking at the key signature table, this indicates either E♭ major or C minor
- Looking at the melody and final cadence, we see a strong emphasis on G as dominant and C as tonic
- The presence of Bn (raised 7th) confirms C minor
Therefore, the key is C minor

2. Second last chord:
- Bass note is C
- Notes from bottom to top: C, G, C, E♭
- This forms a C minor triad
Root/quality chord symbol: Cm

3. Last chord:
- Bass note is G
- Notes from bottom to top: G, B, D
- This forms a G major triad
Root/quality chord symbol: G

4. Functional chord symbols:
- Second last chord (Cm) in C minor = i
- Last chord (G) in C minor = V

5. Cadence type:
- The progression moves from i to V
- Since it ends on V (dominant), this is a half cadence

Final answers:
- Key: C minor
- Second last chord root/quality: Cm
- Last chord root/quality: G
- Second last chord function: i
- Last chord function: V
- Cadence type: Half cadence
