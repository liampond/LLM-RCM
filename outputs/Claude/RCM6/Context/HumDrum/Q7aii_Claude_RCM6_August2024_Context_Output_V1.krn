KEY SIGNATURE ANALYSIS:
1. Looking at the key signature: [b-e-a-d-g-]
- There are 5 flats: B♭, E♭, A♭, D♭, G♭
2. Using the key signature table:
- 5 flats corresponds to D♭ Major or B♭ Minor
3. Additional clues:
- The piece starts and ends on A♭
- The melody emphasizes A♭ and uses notes from the D♭ major scale
- There are no accidentals suggesting a raised seventh of B♭ minor
Therefore, this piece is in D♭ MAJOR.

TIME SIGNATURE ANALYSIS:
Step 1: Identify Beat Groupings
Measure 1: 8a- (one eighth note)
Measure 2: 8dd-L 8dd-J 8ffL 8ffJ (four eighth notes paired in twos)
Measure 3: 4dd- 8a-L 8a-J (one quarter note + two eighth notes)
Measure 4: 8.a-L 16a-Jk 16ee-LL 16dd- 16cc 16b-JJ (dotted eighth + sixteenth + four sixteenths)
Measure 5: 4a- (one quarter note)

Step 2: Analyze Beat Patterns
- Each measure (except the pickup and final measure) contains 2 beats
- The eighth notes are grouped in pairs
- The quarter notes each take one beat
- The sixteenth notes are grouped into one beat

Step 3: Determine Bottom Number
- The quarter note gets one beat
- Therefore, bottom number is 4

Step 4: Count Total Beats
- Each full measure contains 2 beats
- First measure is a pickup (anacrusis)
- Last measure completes the pickup to make a full 2-beat measure

SUMMARY:
Key: D♭ Major (5 flats)
Time Signature: 2/4 (simple duple meter)
The piece begins with an eighth note pickup and consists of four complete measures plus a final quarter note.
