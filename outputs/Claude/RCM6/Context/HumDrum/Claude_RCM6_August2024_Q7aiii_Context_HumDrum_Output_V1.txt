[TextBlock(text='Let me analyze this step by step.

KEY SIGNATURE ANALYSIS:
1. Looking at the key signature (*k[f#]), there is one sharp (F#)
2. According to the key signature table:
   - One sharp could indicate either G Major or E Minor
3. Looking for clues to determine major vs minor:
   - The piece contains D# accidentals (marked with X in the notation)
   - D# is the raised 7th degree in E minor (leading tone)
   - The melodic content emphasizes E minor tonality
4. Therefore, the key is E MINOR

TIME SIGNATURE ANALYSIS:
Step 1: Identify Beat Groupings
Measure 1:
- 16r (sixteenth rest)
- Group of 5 sixteenth notes (16gLL 16a 16b 16cc 16aJJ)
Total: 6 sixteenth notes

Measure 2:
- Group of 6 sixteenth notes (16bLL 16g 16f# 16e 16d# 16aJJ)
Total: 6 sixteenth notes

Measure 3:
- 32gLLL 32f#J (equivalent to one sixteenth)
- 16eJ (one sixteenth)
- 8eeJ (two sixteenths)
- 8r (two sixteenths)
Total: 6 sixteenth notes

Measure 4:
Similar pattern to measure 3:
- 32dd#XLLL 32cc#XJ (one sixteenth)
- 16bJ (one sixteenth)
- 8aaJ (two sixteenths)
- 8r (two sixteenths)
Total: 6 sixteenth notes

Step 2: Determine Bottom Number
- The smallest consistent division is sixteenth notes
- The groupings suggest compound meter (groups of 3)
- Therefore, bottom number is 8 (compound meter based on eighth notes)

Step 3: Count Total Beats
- Each measure consistently has 6 sixteenth notes
- In compound meter, this represents 2 groups of 3 sixteenth notes
- This indicates 6/16 time signature

SUMMARY:
Key: E Minor (one sharp in key signature, presence of D# as leading tone)
Time Signature: 6/16 (compound duple meter)
- Each measure contains 6 sixteenth notes
- Organized as 2 groups of 3 sixteenth notes
- The consistent grouping of sixteenth notes and the overall rhythmic structure clearly indicates 6/16 time', type='text')]
