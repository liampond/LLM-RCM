[TextBlock(text="I'll analyze each measure of the provided music file to determine the intervals between the two notes in each measure.

Measure 1: A to G♯
Step 1: Notes are A (lower) and G♯ (higher)
Step 2: A(1), B(2), C(3), D(4), E(5), F(6), G(7)
Step 3: In A major scale (A,B,C♯,D,E,F♯,G♯), G♯ is present
Step 4: This matches the major scale
Final: Major seventh

Measure 2: F♯ to B♭
Step 1: Notes are F♯ (lower) and B♭ (higher)
Step 2: F(1), G(2), A(3), B(4)
Step 3: In F♯ major scale (F♯,G♯,A♯,B,C♯,D♯,E♯), B♭ is two semitones lower than B
Step 4: This makes it diminished
Final: Diminished fourth

Measure 3: E to C♯
Step 1: Notes are E (lower) and C♯ (higher)
Step 2: E(1), F(2), G(3), A(4), B(5), C(6)
Step 3: In E major scale (E,F♯,G♯,A,B,C♯,D♯), C♯ is present
Step 4: This matches the major scale
Final: Major sixth

Measure 4: C♭ to D
Step 1: Notes are C♭ (lower) and D (higher)
Step 2: C(1), D(2)
Step 3: In C♭ major scale (C♭,D♭,E♭,F♭,G♭,A♭,B♭), D is three semitones higher than D♭
Step 4: This makes it augmented
Final: Augmented second

Measure 5: B to F♯
Step 1: Notes are B (lower) and F♯ (higher)
Step 2: B(1), C(2), D(3), E(4), F(5)
Step 3: In B major scale (B,C♯,D♯,E,F♯,G♯,A♯), F♯ is present
Step 4: This matches the major scale
Final: Perfect fifth", type='text')]
