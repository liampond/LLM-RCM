KEY SIGNATURE ANALYSIS:
1. Looking at the key signature in the MEI file:
- I see "keySig xml:id="k3fsqpg" sig="1s""
- This indicates one sharp in the key signature
2. Consulting the key signature table:
- 1 sharp could indicate either G Major or E Minor
3. Additional analysis:
- The piece frequently uses F# (indicated by accid.ges="s")
- The melodic patterns center around G, B, and D (G major triad)
- No raised seventh degree typical of minor keys is present
4. Conclusion: The piece is in G Major

TIME SIGNATURE ANALYSIS:
1. Examining beat groupings:
Measure 0: 
- One 16th note pickup

Measure 1:
- Three notes per beam, all 16th notes (3 groups of 3 sixteenths)
- Four such groupings total
- Each group = 3/16 duration
- Total measure = 12 sixteenths

Measure 2:
- Similar groupings of three 16th notes
- Final group has an eighth note (equal to 2 sixteenths)
- Total measure = 12 sixteenths

2. Pattern Analysis:
- Consistent grouping of three 16th notes
- Each group represents one beat
- 12 sixteenth notes per full measure
- This suggests compound meter

3. Determining Bottom Number:
- Smallest beat unit is a 16th note
- Bottom number will be 16

4. Determining Top Number:
- 12 sixteenth notes per measure
- Top number will be 12

SUMMARY:
Key: G Major (1 sharp)
Time Signature: 12/16 (compound quadruple meter)

This piece is written in G Major with one sharp (F#) in the key signature. The time signature is 12/16, which creates a compound quadruple feel with four main beats per measure, each beat subdivided into three sixteenth notes. The consistent grouping of three sixteenth notes throughout the piece confirms this meter.', type='text')]
