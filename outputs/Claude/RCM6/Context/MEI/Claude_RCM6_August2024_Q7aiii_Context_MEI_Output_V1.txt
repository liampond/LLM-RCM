[TextBlock(text='Let me analyze this step by step.

KEY SIGNATURE ANALYSIS:
1. Looking at the key signature in the MEI file:
- I see "keySig xml:id="k1mm9spb" sig="1s"" 
- This indicates one sharp in the key signature
2. Consulting the key signature table:
- 1 sharp could indicate either G Major or E Minor
3. Looking for clues to determine major vs minor:
- The piece has an accidental D# (measure 2)
- The melodic movement and emphasis seems to center around G
- No consistent raised seventh degree that would indicate E minor
4. Conclusion for key: G Major

TIME SIGNATURE ANALYSIS:
Let\'s analyze each measure\'s rhythmic groupings:

Measure 1:
- 16th rest (2 ppq)
- Five 16th notes beamed together (2 ppq each = 10 ppq)
- Total = 12 ppq

Measure 2:
- Six 16th notes beamed together (2 ppq each = 12 ppq)
- Total = 12 ppq

Measure 3:
- Two 32nd notes (1 ppq each = 2 ppq)
- One 16th note (2 ppq)
- One 8th note (4 ppq)
- One 8th rest (4 ppq)
- Total = 12 ppq

Measure 4:
- Two 32nd notes (1 ppq each = 2 ppq)
- One 16th note (2 ppq)
- One 8th note (4 ppq)
- One 8th rest (4 ppq)
- Total = 12 ppq

Analysis:
1. Each measure consistently has 12 ppq (pulses per quarter)
2. The groupings suggest compound meter (groups of three)
3. The smallest regular division is the 16th note
4. The beaming patterns suggest groupings of 6/16

Conclusion for time signature: 6/16
(Two main beats per measure, each divided into three 16th notes)

SUMMARY:
Key: G Major (one sharp in key signature, melodic emphasis on G)
Time Signature: 6/16 (compound duple meter, with six sixteenth notes per measure)

The piece is a lively work in compound meter with frequent sixteenth and thirty-second note figures, written in G Major.', type='text')]
