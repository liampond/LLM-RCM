KEY SIGNATURE ANALYSIS:
1. Looking at the key signature, I see 5 flats (sig="5f")
2. According to the key signature table:
   - 5 flats corresponds to either D♭ Major or B♭ Minor
3. Looking for clues to determine major vs minor:
   - The piece starts and ends on A♭
   - The melody emphasizes A♭ and uses notes from the B♭ minor scale
   - The overall melodic contour suggests B♭ minor
Therefore, the key is B♭ minor (5 flats: B♭, E♭, A♭, D♭, G♭)

TIME SIGNATURE ANALYSIS:
Let\'s analyze each measure:

Measure 0 (pickup):
- One eighth note (2 ppq)

Measure 1:
- Two eighth notes beamed together (2+2 ppq)
- Two eighth notes beamed together (2+2 ppq)
Total = 8 ppq

Measure 2:
- One quarter note (4 ppq)
- Two eighth notes beamed together (2+2 ppq)
Total = 8 ppq

Measure 3:
- Dotted eighth + sixteenth (3+1 ppq)
- Four sixteenth notes beamed (1+1+1+1 ppq)
Total = 8 ppq

Measure 4:
- One quarter note (4 ppq)
Total = 4 ppq (final measure)

Analysis:
1. Each full measure contains 8 ppq
2. Notes are grouped in simple time (not compound)
3. The eighth note appears to be the basic unit of subdivision
4. With 8 ppq per measure divided into regular groupings, this suggests 4/4 time

SUMMARY:
Key: B♭ minor (5 flats)
Time Signature: 4/4 (Common Time)
- Each measure contains 8 ppq (pulses per quarter)
- Regular groupings of eighth and quarter notes
- Simple quadruple meter
- The pickup measure contains one eighth note
