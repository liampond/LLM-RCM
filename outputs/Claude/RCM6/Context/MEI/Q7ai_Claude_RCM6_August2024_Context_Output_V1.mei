KEY SIGNATURE ANALYSIS:
1. Looking at the key signature, I see "sig="1s"" in the MEI code
2. Consulting the key signature table:
   1 sharp corresponds to either G Major or E Minor
3. Looking for clues to determine major vs minor:
   - The piece uses notes G, B, F#, D, E, C frequently
   - The melodic patterns emphasize G (G-B-F#-G pattern repeats)
   - No raised seventh degree that would indicate minor key
   - Strong emphasis on G major triad (G-B-D)
4. Conclusion: The key is G Major

TIME SIGNATURE ANALYSIS:
1. Analyzing beat groupings:
   - Measure 0: Single 16th note pickup
   - Measure 1: Four groups of three 16th notes (G-B-F#, G-B-D, G-B-F#, G-B-D)
   - Measure 2: Three 16th notes, dotted 8th+16th, three 16th notes, 8th note

2. Determining beat structure:
   - Each group of three 16th notes = 0.75 beats
   - This suggests compound time (groupings of three)
   - The smallest unit is a 16th note

3. Analyzing total measure length:
   - Measure 1: 12 sixteenth notes (4 groups of 3)
   - Measure 2: 10 sixteenth notes equivalent
   - The consistency of Measure 1 suggests it represents the full time signature

4. Calculating time signature:
   - Bottom number: 16 (sixteenth notes are the basic unit)
   - Top number: 12 (total number of sixteenth notes in a complete measure)

SUMMARY:
Key: G Major (1 sharp)
Time Signature: 12/16 (compound quadruple meter)

The piece is written in G Major, with one sharp (F#) in the key signature. The time signature is 12/16, which creates a compound quadruple feel with four main beats per measure, each divided into three sixteenth notes. This is evidenced by the consistent grouping of three sixteenth notes throughout the first full measure and the overall rhythmic structure of the piece.
