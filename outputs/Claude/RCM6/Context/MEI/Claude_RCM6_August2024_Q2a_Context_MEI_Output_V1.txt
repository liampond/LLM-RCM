[TextBlock(text="I'll analyze each measure and determine the appropriate rests to replace the x-shaped noteheads, following the beat patterns and rules for combining rests.

Measure 1 (4/2 time):
- Has a dotted quarter note, quarter note x-head, and sixteenth note
- Replace x-head with quarter rest

Measure 2 (4/2 time):
- Has triplet eighth notes, quarter note x-head
- Replace x-head with quarter rest

Measure 3 (6/4 time):
- Has sixteenth + dotted eighth beam, quarter note x-head, dotted quarter note
- Replace x-head with quarter rest

Measure 4 (6/4 time):
- Has quarter note x-head, eighth note, beamed eighth notes, quarter note
- Replace x-head with quarter rest

Measure 5 (9/8 time):
- Has beamed sixteenth-eighth-sixteenth, quarter note x-head
- Replace x-head with quarter rest

Measure 6 (9/8 time):
- Has sixteenth note, quarter note x-head, eighth note, beamed sixteenths and eighth
- Replace x-head with quarter rest

Measure 7 (3/4 time):
- Has quarter note x-head
- Replace x-head with quarter rest

Measure 8 (3/4 time):
- Has dotted sixteenth note, quarter note x-head
- Replace x-head with quarter rest

Summary:
All x-shaped noteheads should be replaced with quarter rests. The rhythmic patterns maintain proper beat groupings within their respective time signatures (4/2, 6/4, 9/8, and 3/4), and the quarter rests fit naturally within the existing rhythmic context without disrupting the metric flow.", type='text')]
