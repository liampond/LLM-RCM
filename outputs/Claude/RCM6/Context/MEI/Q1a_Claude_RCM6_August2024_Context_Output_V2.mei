[TextBlock(text="I'll analyze each measure of the provided MEI file to determine the intervals between the notes:

Measure 1:
Notes: A4 to G5
Process:
- Count: A(1), B(2), C(3), D(4), E(5), F(6), G(7)
- A major scale: A, B, C♯, D, E, F♯, G♯
- G is one semitone lower than G♯
Final interval: Minor seventh

Measure 2:
Notes: F♯4 to B♭4
Process:
- Count: F(1), G(2), A(3), B(4)
- F♯ major scale: F♯, G♯, A♯, B, C♯, D♯, E♯
- B♭ is two semitones lower than B
Final interval: Diminished fourth

Measure 3:
Notes: E4 to C♯5
Process:
- Count: E(1), F(2), G(3), A(4), B(5), C(6)
- E major scale: E, F♯, G♯, A, B, C♯, D♯
- C♯ matches the major scale
Final interval: Major sixth

Measure 4:
Notes: C♭5 to D5
Process:
- Count: C(1), D(2)
- C♭ major scale: C♭, D♭, E♭, F♭, G♭, A♭, B♭
- D natural is two semitones higher than D♭
Final interval: Augmented second

Measure 5:
Notes: B4 to F♯5
Process:
- Count: B(1), C(2), D(3), E(4), F(5)
- B major scale: B, C♯, D♯, E, F♯, G♯, A♯
- F♯ matches the major scale
Final interval: Perfect fifth", type='text')]
