[TextBlock(text="Let me help you transpose this melody from E major (4 sharps) to A♭ major (4 flats).

First, let's find the interval of transposition:
From E to A♭ is an augmented third:
E (1), F (2), G (3), A♭ (4)
Since A♭ is a half step higher than what would be the natural third in an E major scale (G♯), this makes it an augmented third.

Now, let's transpose each measure up by an augmented third:

Original -> Transposed
Measure 1:
E -> A♭
G♯ -> C
B -> E♭

Measure 2:
D♯ -> G
E -> A♭
F♯ -> B♭
E -> A♭
(Quarter rest remains a rest)

Measure 3:
C♯ -> F
B -> E♭
E -> A♭

Measure 4:
B -> E♭
A -> D♭
G♯ -> C
A -> D♭
G♯ -> C
(Quarter rest remains a rest)

The rhythms remain exactly the same as the original:
- Measure 1: half note, quarter note, quarter note
- Measure 2: dotted quarter, two sixteenths, quarter, quarter rest
- Measure 3: half note, quarter note, quarter note
- Measure 4: quarter note, eighth note, two sixteenths, quarter note, quarter rest

The new key signature should be four flats (A♭, B♭, D♭, E♭).", type='text')]
