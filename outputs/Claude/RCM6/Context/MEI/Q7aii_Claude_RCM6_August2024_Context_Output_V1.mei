[TextBlock(text='Let me analyze this step by step.

KEY SIGNATURE ANALYSIS:
1. Looking at the key signature, I see 5 flats (sig="5f")
2. According to the key signature table:
   - 5 flats corresponds to either Db Major or Bb Minor
3. Looking at the melodic content:
   - The piece starts and ends on Ab notes
   - The melody emphasizes Ab and Db notes
   - No raised seventh degree is apparent
4. Therefore, this piece is in Db Major

TIME SIGNATURE ANALYSIS:
Let\'s analyze each measure:

Measure 0 (pickup):
- One eighth note (2 ppq)

Measure 1:
- Two eighth notes beamed together (2+2 ppq)
- Two eighth notes beamed together (2+2 ppq)
Total = 8 ppq

Measure 2:
- One quarter note (4 ppq)
- Two eighth notes beamed together (2+2 ppq)
Total = 8 ppq

Measure 3:
- Dotted eighth + sixteenth beamed (3+1 ppq)
- Four sixteenth notes beamed (1+1+1+1 ppq)
Total = 8 ppq

Measure 4:
- One quarter note (4 ppq)
Total = 4 ppq (final measure)

Analysis:
1. Each full measure contains 8 ppq (pulses per quarter)
2. The beat groupings suggest simple time
3. The eighth notes are grouped in pairs
4. Each measure (except pickup and final) has 8 ppq, equivalent to 2 quarter notes
5. This strongly indicates a 2/4 time signature

SUMMARY:
Key: Db Major (5 flats)
Time Signature: 2/4
- The piece is in simple duple meter
- Each measure contains two quarter note beats
- The eighth notes are consistently grouped in pairs, supporting this conclusion
- The pickup measure and rhythmic patterns are all consistent with 2/4 time
