[TextBlock(text='Let me analyze this step by step.

KEY SIGNATURE ANALYSIS:
1. Looking at the key signature, I see "sig="1s"" in the MEI code
2. Consulting the key signature table:
   1 sharp corresponds to either G Major or E Minor
3. Looking for clues to determine major vs minor:
   - The piece uses notes G, B, F#, D, E, C frequently
   - The melodic patterns emphasize G and B
   - There are no accidentals beyond the F# from the key signature
   - The patterns suggest G major triads (G-B-D)
4. Conclusion: The piece is in G Major

TIME SIGNATURE ANALYSIS:
1. Analyzing beam groupings in measure 1:
   - Each beam contains 3 sixteenth notes
   - There are 4 groups of 3 sixteenth notes
   - Each group = 3/16 duration
   - Total measure = 12 sixteenth notes

2. Analyzing beam groupings in measure 2:
   - First beam: 3 sixteenth notes
   - Second beam: eighth note + sixteenth note (= 3 sixteenth notes)
   - Third beam: 3 sixteenth notes
   - Final note: eighth note (= 2 sixteenth notes)
   - Total measure = 11 sixteenth notes

3. Pattern Analysis:
   - The consistent grouping of 3 sixteenth notes suggests compound meter
   - Each group of 3 sixteenth notes forms one beat
   - In measure 1, we have 4 complete beats
   - In measure 2, we have 4 beats (last beat shortened due to the piece ending)

4. Determining Time Signature:
   - Bottom number: 8 (since each beat divides into 3 eighth notes)
   - Top number: 12 (4 beats Ã— 3 eighth notes per beat)

SUMMARY:
Key: G Major (1 sharp - F#)
Time Signature: 12/8 (compound quadruple meter)
The piece consistently groups sixteenth notes in threes, creating a compound meter feel with four main beats per measure, each beat subdivided into three parts.
