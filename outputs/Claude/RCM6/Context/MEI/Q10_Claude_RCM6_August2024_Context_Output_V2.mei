[TextBlock(text='Let me analyze each question:

1. Key of the piece:
Looking at the key signature with one flat (Bb), this indicates either F major or D minor. Based on the melodic content and cadences, this piece is in F major.

2. Time signature:
Looking at the beam groupings (3+3 eighth notes per measure) and total duration per measure, this is 6/8 time.

3. First three eighth notes of bar 2:
The notes F-Bb-D outline a Bb major triad, which is the subdominant triad in F major.

4. Interval between last eighth note of bar 2 (C) and first note of bar 3 (E):
From C to E is a major third.

5. Functional chord symbol for first three eighth notes of bar 5:
The notes F-A-C outline an F major triad, which is the tonic chord (I).

6. Last three eighth notes of bar 7:
The notes C-E-G outline a C major triad, which is the dominant triad.

7. Interval between second and third eighth notes in left hand of bar 8:
From E to Bb is a diminished fifth.

8. Rest needed at end of bar 8:
In 6/8 time, after a quarter note F, an eighth rest is needed to complete the measure.

9. Period type:
This is a parallel period because the consequent phrase (bars 5-8) begins with the same melodic material as the antecedent phrase (bars 1-4).

10. Allegretto vivace meaning:
This tempo marking means "fairly quick and lively," combining allegretto (moderately fast) with vivace (vivacious, bright).

Summary:
This piece is a parallel period in F major, written in 6/8 time. It demonstrates clear harmonic progression through primary triads (I, IV, V) and features consistent rhythmic patterns of grouped eighth notes. The parallel period structure is evident in the matching opening material of both phrases, while the tempo marking suggests a bright, energetic performance style.
