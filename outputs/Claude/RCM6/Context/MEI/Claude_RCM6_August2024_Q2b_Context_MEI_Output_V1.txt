[TextBlock(text='Let me analyze the rhythms in the provided MEI file to determine the time signature.

Measure 1 contains:
- Dotted quarter note (F4) = 12 ppq = 3/8
- Eighth note (F4) = 4 ppq = 1/8
- Two sixteenth notes (F4) = 2 ppq each = 1/8 total
- Eighth note (F4) = 4 ppq = 1/8
- Two eighth notes (F4) = 4 ppq each = 2/8 total

Total for measure 1 = 32 ppq = 8/8 = 4/4

Measure 2 contains:
- Two sixteenth notes (F4) = 2 ppq each = 1/8 total
- Two thirty-second notes (F4) = 1 ppq each = 1/16 total
- Dotted sixteenth note (F4) = 3 ppq = 3/32
- Thirty-second note (F4) = 1 ppq = 1/32
- Sixteenth note (F4) = 2 ppq = 1/16
- Eighth note (F4) = 4 ppq = 1/8
- Sixteenth note (F4) = 2 ppq = 1/16

Total for measure 2 = 32 ppq = 8/8 = 4/4

Looking at the beam groupings and total rhythmic values:
1. Each measure adds up to exactly 32 ppq
2. The groupings suggest a simple quadruple meter
3. The beat unit appears to be a quarter note (as evidenced by the dotted quarter note starting measure 1)

Therefore, the time signature for this piece is 4/4 (Common Time).

This conclusion is supported by:
- The total duration of each measure being equivalent to 4 quarter notes
- The rhythmic groupings that align with typical 4/4 beat divisions
- The consistent 32 ppq (pulses per quarter) across both measures', type='text')]
