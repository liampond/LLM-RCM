KEY SIGNATURE ANALYSIS:
1. Looking at the key signature, I see 5 flats (<keySig xml:id="k5tepqz" sig="5f" />)
2. According to the key signature table:
   - 5 flats corresponds to either D♭ Major or B♭ Minor
3. Looking for clues to determine major vs minor:
   - The piece starts and ends on A♭
   - The melodic content emphasizes A♭ and uses notes from the D♭ major scale
   - There are no raised seventh scale degrees that would indicate minor
4. Therefore, this piece is in D♭ Major

TIME SIGNATURE ANALYSIS:
Let\'s analyze the rhythmic groupings measure by measure:

Measure 0 (pickup):
- One eighth note (2 ppq)

Measure 1:
- Two eighth notes beamed together (2+2 ppq)
- Two eighth notes beamed together (2+2 ppq)
Total = 8 ppq

Measure 2:
- One quarter note (4 ppq)
- Two eighth notes beamed together (2+2 ppq)
Total = 8 ppq

Measure 3:
- Dotted eighth + sixteenth note beamed (3+1 ppq)
- Four sixteenth notes beamed (1+1+1+1 ppq)
Total = 8 ppq

Measure 4:
- One quarter note (4 ppq)

Since each full measure contains 8 ppq (pulses per quarter), and the groupings suggest simple time with quarter note beats, this indicates:
- Bottom number: 4 (quarter note gets the beat)
- Top number: 2 (two beats per measure)
Therefore, the time signature is 2/4

SUMMARY:
- Key: D♭ Major (5 flats)
- Time Signature: 2/4
The piece is written in simple duple meter with each measure containing two quarter note beats, and is in the key of D♭ major as indicated by the five flats in the key signature.', type='text')]
