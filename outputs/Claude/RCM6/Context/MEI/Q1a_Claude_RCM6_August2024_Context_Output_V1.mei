[TextBlock(text="I'll analyze each measure's intervals following the process outlined:

Measure 1: A4 to G5
Step 1: Notes are A (lower) to G (higher)
Step 2: A(1), B(2), C(3), D(4), E(5), F(6), G(7)
Step 3: In A major scale (A,B,C♯,D,E,F♯,G♯), G natural is one semitone lower than G♯
Final Answer: Minor seventh

Measure 2: F♯4 to B♭4
Step 1: Notes are F♯ (lower) to B♭ (higher)
Step 2: F(1), G(2), A(3), B(4)
Step 3: In F♯ major scale (F♯,G♯,A♯,B,C♯,D♯,E♯), B♭ is two semitones lower than B
Final Answer: Diminished fourth

Measure 3: E4 to C♯5
Step 1: Notes are E (lower) to C♯ (higher)
Step 2: E(1), F(2), G(3), A(4), B(5), C(6)
Step 3: In E major scale (E,F♯,G♯,A,B,C♯,D♯), C♯ matches
Final Answer: Major sixth

Measure 4: C♭5 to D5
Step 1: Notes are C♭ (lower) to D (higher)
Step 2: C(1), D(2)
Step 3: In C♭ major scale (C♭,D♭,E♭,F♭,G♭,A♭,B♭), D natural is two semitones higher than D♭
Final Answer: Augmented second

Measure 5: B4 to F♯5
Step 1: Notes are B (lower) to F♯ (higher)
Step 2: B(1), C(2), D(3), E(4), F(5)
Step 3: In B major scale (B,C♯,D♯,E,F♯,G♯,A♯), F♯ matches
Final Answer: Perfect fifth", type='text')]
