KEY SIGNATURE ANALYSIS:
1. Looking at the key signature, I see one sharp (sig="1s")
2. According to the key signature table, one sharp could indicate either:
   - G Major
   - E Minor
3. Looking for clues to determine major vs minor:
   - The piece has accidentals: D# and C# appear in measure 4
   - The melodic content centers around G and its related notes
   - The piece begins with G and has strong G-centric movement
4. Based on these observations, this piece appears to be in G Major

TIME SIGNATURE ANALYSIS:
Let\'s analyze each measure\'s rhythmic groupings:

Measure 1:
- 16th rest + five 16th notes (2+2+2+2+2+2 = 12 sixteenth notes)

Measure 2:
- Six 16th notes (2+2+2+2+2+2 = 12 sixteenth notes)

Measure 3:
- Two 32nd notes (1+1)
- One 16th note (2)
- One 8th note (4)
- One 8th rest (4)
Total = 12 sixteenth notes

Measure 4:
- Two 32nd notes (1+1)
- One 16th note (2)
- One 8th note (4)
- One 8th rest (4)
Total = 12 sixteenth notes

Analysis:
1. Each measure consistently contains 12 sixteenth notes
2. The groupings suggest compound meter (divisible by 3)
3. The bottom number should be 16 since sixteenth notes are the basic unit
4. 12/16 is a compound meter with four groups of three sixteenth notes

SUMMARY:
Key: G Major (one sharp in key signature, strong G Major tonality)
Time Signature: 12/16 (compound quadruple meter, with each measure containing twelve sixteenth notes grouped in four sets of three)
