[TextBlock(text="Let me analyze this melody:

For the key:
- There is one sharp in the key signature (F#)
- This indicates the key is G major

For the time signature:
- Looking at each measure's note durations:
- Each measure contains 12 sixteenth notes worth of time (or equivalent durations)
- This means each measure has 3 quarter notes worth of time
- Therefore, this piece is in 3/4 time signature

So:
Key: G major
Time Signature: 3/4

I determined this by:
1. Counting that each measure consistently adds up to 12 sixteenth notes (or equivalent durations):
- Measure 1: 1 sixteenth rest + 5 sixteenth notes = 12/16
- Measure 2: 6 sixteenth notes = 12/16
- Measure 3: 2 thirty-seconds + 1 sixteenth + 1 eighth + 1 eighth rest = 12/16
- Measure 4: 2 thirty-seconds + 1 sixteenth + 1 eighth + 1 eighth rest = 12/16

Since 12 sixteenth notes equals 3 quarter notes, this clearly indicates a 3/4 time signature.", type='text')]
