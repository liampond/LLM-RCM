[TextBlock(text="I'll help analyze each measure and determine the appropriate rests to replace the x-headed notes, working through the piece measure by measure:

Measure 1 (4/2 time):
- Has a dotted quarter note F, then an x-headed quarter note, then a 16th note F
- To replace the x-headed quarter note: Keep it as a quarter rest

Measure 2 (4/2 time):
- Has a triplet of eighth notes F, then an x-headed quarter note
- To replace the x-headed quarter note: Keep it as a quarter rest

Measure 3 (6/4 time):
- Has a 16th note F, dotted eighth note F, x-headed quarter note, dotted quarter note F
- To replace the x-headed quarter note: Keep it as a quarter rest

Measure 4 (6/4 time):
- Has an x-headed quarter note, eighth note F, two beamed eighth notes F, quarter note F
- To replace the x-headed quarter note: Keep it as a quarter rest

Measure 5 (9/8 time):
- Has a 16th note F, eighth note F, 16th note F, x-headed quarter note
- To replace the x-headed quarter note: Keep it as a quarter rest

Measure 6 (9/8 time):
- Has a 16th note F, x-headed quarter note, eighth note F, four 16th notes F beamed together, eighth note F
- To replace the x-headed quarter note: Keep it as a quarter rest

Measure 7 (3/4 time):
- Has only an x-headed quarter note
- To replace the x-headed quarter note: Keep it as a quarter rest

Measure 8 (3/4 time):
- Has a dotted 16th note F, x-headed quarter note
- To replace the x-headed quarter note: Keep it as a quarter rest

In all cases, the x-headed quarter notes should be replaced with quarter rests to maintain the proper rhythmic structure within each measure's time signature.", type='text')]
