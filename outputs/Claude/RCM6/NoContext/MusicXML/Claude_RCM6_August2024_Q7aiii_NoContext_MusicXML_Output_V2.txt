[TextBlock(text="Let me analyze this melody:

For the key:
- There is one sharp in the key signature (F#)
- This indicates the key is G major

For the time signature:
- Looking at each measure's note durations:
- Each measure contains 12 sixteenth notes worth of time (or equivalent durations)
- This means each measure has 3 quarter notes worth of time
- Therefore, this piece is in 3/4 time signature

So:
Key: G major
Time Signature: 3/4

I determined this by:
1. Counting that each measure consistently has 12 sixteenth notes worth of duration (whether through actual sixteenth notes, eighth notes, thirty-second notes, or rests)
2. Since 12 sixteenth notes = 3 quarter notes, and the melody has a clear triple feel, this points to 3/4 time", type='text')]
