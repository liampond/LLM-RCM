[TextBlock(text="I'll analyze the intervals between the two notes in each measure, going from bottom to top:

Measure 1: A4 to G5 = Major 7th
Measure 2: F#4 to Bb4 = Diminished 4th

Measure 4: D5 to Cb5 = Diminished 7th
Measure 5: B4 to F#5 = Perfect 5th

Note: For each measure, I analyzed the interval from the lower note to the higher note, counting both the quality (major, minor, perfect, diminished, augmented) and the numerical distance (2nd through 8th).", type='text')]
