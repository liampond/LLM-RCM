[TextBlock(text="I'll analyze the intervals between the two notes in each measure:

Measure 1: A4 to G5 = Major 7th
Measure 2: F#4 to Bb4 = Diminished 4th
Measure 3: E4 to C#5 = Major 6th
Measure 4: D5 to Cb5 = Diminished 7th
Measure 5: B4 to F#5 = Perfect 5th

Each measure contains two notes played simultaneously (as a chord), and I've listed the interval from the lower note to the higher note in each case.", type='text')]
