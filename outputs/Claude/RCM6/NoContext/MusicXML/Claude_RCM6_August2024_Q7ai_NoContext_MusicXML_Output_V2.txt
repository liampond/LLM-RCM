[TextBlock(text='Let me analyze this for you:

Key Signature:
- There is one sharp (F#) in the key signature, which indicates the key of G major.

Time Signature:
- Looking at the rhythmic groupings in each measure:
- Each measure contains 12 sixteenth notes (or their equivalent in longer note values)
- 12 sixteenth notes equals 3 quarter notes (since 4 sixteenth notes = 1 quarter note)
- Therefore, this piece is in 3/4 time signature

So:
- Key: G major
- Time Signature: 3/4

This can be verified by observing that each measure consistently contains either:
- 12 sixteenth notes, or
- A combination of sixteenth notes and eighth notes that add up to 3 quarter notes worth of duration', type='text')]
