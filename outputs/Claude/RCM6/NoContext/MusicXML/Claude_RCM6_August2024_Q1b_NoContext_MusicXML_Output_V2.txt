[TextBlock(text='Let me help you find these intervals from each given note:

1. First note is Bb2:
- Perfect 4th above Bb2 = Eb3

2. Second note is D#3:
- Major 3rd above D#3 = G#3

3. Third note is Gb2:
- Diminished 8ve above Gb2 = Gbb3 (double flat)

4. Fourth note is Cb3:
- Augmented 6th above Cb3 = A3

5. Fifth note is E2:
- Minor 2nd above E2 = F2

I arrived at these answers by:
1. Counting up the correct number of scale degrees
2. Applying the specific interval quality (perfect, major, minor, diminished, augmented)
3. Adding any necessary accidentals to achieve the requested interval quality', type='text')]
