[TextBlock(text="I'll analyze the intervals between the two notes in each measure, going from bottom to top:

Measure 1: A4 to G5 = Major 7th
Measure 2: F#4 to Bb4 = Diminished 4th
Measure 3: E4 to C#5 = Augmented 6th
Measure 4: D5 to Cb5 = Diminished 7th
Measure 5: B4 to F#5 = Perfect 5th

Each measure contains two notes played simultaneously (as chords), and I've calculated the interval from the lower note to the higher note in each case, taking into account all accidentals and the key signature of D major (2 sharps: F# and C#).", type='text')]
