[TextBlock(text="Let me analyze this melody:

For the key:
- There is one sharp in the key signature (F#)
- This indicates the key is G major

For the time signature:
- Looking at each measure's note durations:
Measure 1: 6 sixteenth notes (6/16)
Measure 2: 6 sixteenth notes (6/16)
Measure 3: 2 thirty-second notes + 1 sixteenth + 1 eighth + 1 eighth rest (6/16)
Measure 4: 2 thirty-second notes + 1 sixteenth + 1 eighth + 1 eighth rest (6/16)

Since each measure consistently contains the equivalent of 6 sixteenth notes, this piece is in 6/16 time.

Therefore:
