[TextBlock(text='Let me help determine the time signature by adding up the note durations in each measure.

For Measure 1:
- Dotted quarter note (12/8)
- Eighth note (4/8)
- Two sixteenth notes (2/8 + 2/8)
- Eighth note (4/8)
- Two eighth notes (4/8 + 4/8)

Total for measure 1: 32/8 = 4/4 time

For Measure 2:
- Two sixteenth notes (2/8 + 2/8)
- Two thirty-second notes (1/8 + 1/8)
- Dotted sixteenth note (3/8)
- Thirty-second note (1/8)
- Sixteenth note (2/8)
- Eighth note (4/8)
- Sixteenth note (2/8)

Total for measure 2: 32/8 = 4/4 time

Based on these calculations, this piece is in 4/4 time signature (common time).', type='text')]
