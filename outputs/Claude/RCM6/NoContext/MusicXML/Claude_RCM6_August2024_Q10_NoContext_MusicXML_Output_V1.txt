[TextBlock(text='Let me answer each question:

1. Key: F major (one flat - Bb)

2. Time Signature: 6/8 (analyzing the rhythmic groupings and beaming patterns shows consistent 6/8 meter throughout)

3. Chord in first three eighth notes of bar 2: Subdominant triad (Bb-D-F outlining IV chord in F major)

4. Interval between last eighth note of bar 2 and first note of bar 3: Perfect fifth (from C up to F)

5. Functional chord symbol for first three eighth notes of bar 5: I (F major triad - F-A-C)

6. Chord outlined by last three eighth notes of bar 7: C major triad (C-E-G, which is V in F major)

7. Interval between second and third eighth notes in left hand of bar 8: Perfect fifth (from E up to Bb)

8. Rest at end of bar 8: Eighth rest (to complete the 6/8 measure after the quarter note F)

9. This is a parallel period (the melodic material in bars 5-8 closely mirrors the material from bars 1-4, with similar rhythmic and melodic contours but ending with a stronger cadence)

10. Allegretto vivace means "fairly quick and lively" - Allegretto indicates a moderately fast tempo (slightly slower than allegro), while vivace adds a characteristically bright, spirited, and animated quality to the performance', type='text')]
