[TextBlock(text="I'll help analyze each measure and determine the appropriate rests to replace the x-shaped noteheads while maintaining the correct time signature.

Going through each measure:

1. Measure 1 (4/2 time):
- Has a dotted quarter note F (36), x-shaped quarter note (24), and 16th note F (6)
- The x-shaped note should be replaced with a quarter rest

2. Measure 2 (4/2 time):
- Has a triplet of eighth notes (24 total), x-shaped quarter note (24)
- The x-shaped note should be replaced with a quarter rest

3. Measure 3 (6/4 time):
- Has 16th note + dotted eighth (24 total), x-shaped quarter note (24), dotted quarter note (36)
- The x-shaped note should be replaced with a quarter rest

4. Measure 4 (6/4 time):
- Has x-shaped quarter note (24), eighth note (12), two eighth notes (24), quarter note (24)
- The x-shaped note should be replaced with a quarter rest

5. Measure 5 (9/8 time):
- Has 16th + eighth + 16th notes (24 total), x-shaped quarter note (24)
- The x-shaped note should be replaced with a quarter rest

6. Measure 6 (9/8 time):
- Has 16th note (6), x-shaped quarter note (24), eighth note (12), four 16th notes (24), eighth note (12)
- The x-shaped note should be replaced with a quarter rest

7. Measure 7 (3/4 time):
- Has x-shaped quarter note (24)
- The x-shaped note should be replaced with a quarter rest

8. Measure 8 (3/4 time):
- Has dotted 16th note (9), x-shaped quarter note (24)
- The x-shaped note should be replaced with a quarter rest

In all cases, the x-shaped quarter notes should be replaced with quarter rests to maintain the proper rhythmic structure and time signature of each measure.", type='text')]
