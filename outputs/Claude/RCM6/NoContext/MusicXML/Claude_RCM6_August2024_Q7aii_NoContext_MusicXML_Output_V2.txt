[TextBlock(text='Let me analyze this for you:

Key Signature:
- There are 5 flats in the key signature (B♭, E♭, A♭, D♭, G♭)
- This indicates the key is D♭ major or B♭ minor
- Given the melodic content and that it begins and ends on A♭, this piece appears to be in D♭ major

Time Signature:
- Looking at the note durations in each measure:
  - Measure 0 (pickup): 1 eighth note (1/8)
  - Measure 1: 4 eighth notes (4/8)
  - Measure 2: 1 quarter note + 2 eighth notes (4/8)
  - Measure 3: 1 dotted eighth + 1 sixteenth + 4 sixteenth notes (4/8)
  - Measure 4: 1 quarter note (2/8)

Given that most complete measures contain 4 eighth notes worth of duration (except the pickup and final measure), this piece is in 2/4 time signature.

Therefore:
- Key: D♭ major
- Time Signature: 2/4', type='text')]
