[TextBlock(text="Let me analyze the melody:

-Key: E-flat major (3 flats)

-Second last chord (measure 3, last beat): C minor (Cm)
Root is C, quality is minor (C-Eb-G)

-Last chord (measure 4): G major (G)
Root is G, quality is major (G-B-D)

-Functional symbol for second last chord: vi (six minor)

-Functional symbol for last chord: III (three major)
Note: This is unusual as it's the dominant chord but with a major third (B natural instead of Bb), making it a secondary dominant V/vi

-Type of cadence: Half cadence (ends on dominant chord, though modified to be major instead of minor)", type='text')]
