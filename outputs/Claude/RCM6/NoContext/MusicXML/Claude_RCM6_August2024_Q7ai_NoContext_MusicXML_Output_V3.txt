[TextBlock(text='Let me analyze this for you:

Key Signature:
- There is one sharp (F#) in the key signature, which indicates the key of G major.

Time Signature:
- Looking at the rhythmic groupings in each measure:
- Each measure contains 12 sixteenth notes (or their equivalent in longer note values)
- In measure 2, we see combinations of sixteenth notes and eighth notes that also total 12 sixteenth notes
- Since 12 sixteenth notes would equal 3 quarter notes (each quarter note = 4 sixteenth notes)
- This strongly indicates a 3/4 time signature

Therefore:
- Key: G major
- Time Signature: 3/4', type='text')]
