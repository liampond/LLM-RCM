[TextBlock(text='Let me analyze the melody:

Key:
- The key signature has 1 sharp (F#), indicating the key of G major

Time Signature:
- Looking at the rhythmic structure:
- Each full measure contains 12 sixteenth notes (3+3+3+3 in measure 1)
- This suggests a time signature of 12/16
- The grouping of notes in threes (3+3+3+3) is characteristic of compound meter
- Therefore, this could also be written as 4/8 with triplet subdivisions

Summary:
The melody is written in G major with one sharp (F#). While the time signature is hidden in the notation, the consistent grouping of 12 sixteenth notes per measure in groups of three suggests a time signature of 12/16 or 4/8 with triplet subdivisions. The melody has a flowing, compound meter feel with its triplet-based rhythmic structure.', type='text')]
