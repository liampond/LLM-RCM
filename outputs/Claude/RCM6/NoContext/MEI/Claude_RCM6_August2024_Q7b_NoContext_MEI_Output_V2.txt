[TextBlock(text='Let me analyze the melody:

-Key: F# Major (based on the key signature of 3 sharps and the melodic content centered around F#)

-Time Signature: 6/8 (based on the grouping of notes - each measure contains 6 eighth notes or their equivalent, grouped in a compound duple pattern)

Chord symbols by bar:
-Bar 1: F#M (The melody outlines F#-C#-A-B-C#, clearly implying an F# major triad)
-Bar 2: DM (The melody outlines D-B-F#-E-D, suggesting a D major triad)
-Bar 3: C#m (The melody moves through C#-D#-E#-G#-F#-E#, implying C# minor with some chromatic motion)
-Bar 4: F#M (The melody sustains F#, returning to the tonic F# major)

The chromatic motion in bar 3 (with the D# and E#) creates some harmonic tension before resolving back to F# major in the final bar.', type='text')]
