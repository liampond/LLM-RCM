[TextBlock(text="Let me analyze this melody:

Key Signature:
- There are 5 flats in the key signature (Db, Eb, Ab, Bb, Gb)
- This indicates the key of Db Major or Bb minor
- Given the melody's focus around Ab and the overall melodic movement, this piece appears to be in Ab minor

Time Signature:
- Looking at the rhythms in each measure:
  - Measure 0: 1 eighth note (pickup)
  - Measure 1: 4 eighth notes (2 beats)
  - Measure 2: 1 quarter note + 2 eighth notes (2 beats)
  - Measure 3: 1 dotted eighth + sixteenth + 4 sixteenths (2 beats)
  - Measure 4: 1 quarter note (1 beat)

Since each full measure contains 2 beats, and the predominant note values are quarters and eighths, this piece is in 2/4 time signature.
