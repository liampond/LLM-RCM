[TextBlock(text='Let me analyze the melody:

-Key: F# Major (based on the key signature of 3 sharps - F#, C#, G# - and the melodic content centering around F#)

-Time Signature: 6/8 (based on the grouping of notes - each measure contains 6 eighth notes or their equivalent, grouped in a compound duple pattern)

Chord symbols by bar:
-Bar 1: F# Major (melody outlines F#, C#, A, B, C# - clear F# major triad)
-Bar 2: D Major (melody outlines D, B, F#, E, D - D major triad)
-Bar 3: C#7 (melody outlines C#, D#, E#, G#, F#, E# - suggesting C# dominant seventh)
-Bar 4: F# Major (resolves to and holds F# as final note, completing the cadential progression)

This creates a I - VI - V7 - I progression in F# major.', type='text')]
