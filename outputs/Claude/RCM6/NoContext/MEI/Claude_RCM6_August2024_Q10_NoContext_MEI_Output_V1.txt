[TextBlock(text='Let me answer each question:

1. Key: F major (one flat - Bb)

2. Time Signature: 6/8 (analyzing the rhythmic groupings and beaming patterns)

3. The first three eighth notes of bar 2 outline a Bb major triad (Bb-D-F) in both hands, which is the subdominant triad in F major.

4. The interval between the last eighth note in bar 2 (C) and the first note in bar 3 (E) is a major third.

5. The functional chord symbol for the first three eighth notes of bar 5 is I (tonic) in F major, as it outlines an F major triad (F-A-C).

6. The last three eighth notes of bar 7 outline a C major triad (C-E-G), which is the dominant chord (V) in F major.

7. The interval between the second eighth note (E) and third eighth note (Bb) in the left hand of bar 8 is a diminished fifth.

8. An eighth rest should go at the end of bar 8 in the right hand after the F (matching the pattern seen throughout the piece).

9. This is a parallel period, as the melodic material in bars 5-8 closely mirrors that of bars 1-4, with similar rhythmic and melodic content but a different ending.

10. Allegretto vivace means "fairly quick and lively." Allegretto indicates a moderately fast tempo (slightly slower than allegro), while vivace adds a bright, spirited character to the performance.', type='text')]
