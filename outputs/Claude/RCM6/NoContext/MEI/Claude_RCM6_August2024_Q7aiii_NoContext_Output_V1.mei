[TextBlock(text='Let me analyze the melody:

Key:
- The key signature shows 1 sharp (F#), indicating the key of G major
- However, there are accidentals including C# and D#, suggesting temporary tonicization or modulation

Time Signature:
- Each measure contains 12 sixteenth-note (semiquaver) values
- Breaking it down:
  - Measure 1: sixteenth rest + 5 sixteenth notes = 12/16
  - Measure 2: 6 sixteenth notes = 12/16
  - Measure 3: 2 thirty-second notes + 1 sixteenth + 1 eighth + 1 eighth rest = 12/16
  - Measure 4: 2 thirty-second notes + 1 sixteenth + 1 eighth + 1 eighth rest = 12/16
- This consistent pattern indicates a time signature of 12/16

Summary:
The melody is written in G major (with one sharp in the key signature) and has a time signature of 12/16. The melody features some chromatic alterations (C# and D#) and uses a variety of rhythmic values including thirty-second notes, sixteenth notes, and eighth notes, all fitting within the 12/16 meter.', type='text')]
