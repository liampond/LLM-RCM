[TextBlock(text='Let me help transpose this melody from E major to A flat major.

The interval of transposition is up a perfect fourth (P4).

Here are the notes in the original melody (E major):
Measure 1: E4 (half), G#4 (quarter), B4 (quarter)
Measure 2: D#4 (dotted quarter), E4 (16th), F#4 (16th), E4 (quarter), rest (quarter)
Measure 3: C#5 (half), B4 (quarter), E5 (quarter)
Measure 4: B4 (quarter), A4 (eighth), G#4 (16th), A4 (16th), G#4 (quarter), rest (quarter)

Transposed up a P4 to A flat major, the melody becomes:
Measure 1: Ab4 (half), C5 (quarter), Eb5 (quarter)
Measure 2: G4 (dotted quarter), Ab4 (16th), Bb4 (16th), Ab4 (quarter), rest (quarter)
Measure 3: F5 (half), Eb5 (quarter), Ab5 (quarter)
Measure 4: Eb5 (quarter), Db5 (eighth), C5 (16th), Db5 (16th), C5 (quarter), rest (quarter)

The key signature would change from 4 sharps (E major) to 4 flats (Ab major). The time signature remains 4/4 (common time), and all rhythmic values stay exactly the same.', type='text')]
