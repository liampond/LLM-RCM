[TextBlock(text="Let me analyze the melody:

-Key: E♭ major (3 flats: B♭, E♭, A♭)

-Second last chord (measure 3): C minor (Cm)
Looking at the notes: C, E♭, G

-Last chord (measure 4): G major (G)
Looking at the notes: G, B♮, D

-Functional chord symbol for second last chord: vi (submediant)

-Functional chord symbol for last chord: III (mediant)
The G major chord is built on the third scale degree of E♭ major

-Type of cadence: Half cadence
This is a half cadence because it ends on III, which functions like a dominant in this context, creating tension rather than resolution. It doesn't conclude on the tonic (E♭), which would be needed for an authentic cadence.", type='text')]
