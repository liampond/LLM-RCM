[TextBlock(text='Let me help determine the time signature by adding up the rhythmic values in each measure.

For Measure 1:
- Dotted quarter note (12 ppq)
- Eighth note (4 ppq)
- Two sixteenth notes (2 ppq each = 4 ppq)
- Eighth note (4 ppq)
- Two eighth notes (4 ppq each = 8 ppq)

Total for measure 1 = 32 ppq

For Measure 2:
- Two sixteenth notes (2 ppq each = 4 ppq)
- Two thirty-second notes (1 ppq each = 2 ppq)
- Dotted sixteenth note (3 ppq)
- Thirty-second note (1 ppq)
- Sixteenth note (2 ppq)
- Eighth note (4 ppq)
- Sixteenth note (2 ppq)

Total for measure 2 = 18 ppq

Since measure 1 has 32 ppq, and given that this appears to be a standard meter, this would indicate a 4/4 time signature (as 32 ppq = 4 beats at 8 ppq per beat).

However, measure 2 appears incomplete with only 18 ppq, suggesting it might be the final measure of the piece (which often can be incomplete) or there might be some missing notes.

The time signature is 4/4 (Common Time).', type='text')]
