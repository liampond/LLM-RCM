[TextBlock(text='Let me help transpose this melody from E major to A flat major.

The interval of transposition is up a perfect fourth (P4).

Here are the notes in the original melody (E major):
Measure 1: E4 (half), G#4 (quarter), B4 (quarter)
Measure 2: D#4 (dotted quarter), E4-F#4 (sixteenths), E4 (quarter), rest (quarter)
Measure 3: C#5 (half), B4 (quarter), E5 (quarter)
Measure 4: B4 (quarter), A4-G#4-A4 (eighth-sixteenth-sixteenth), G#4 (quarter), rest (quarter)

Transposed up a P4 to A flat major (with 4 flats: B♭, E♭, A♭, D♭):
Measure 1: A♭4 (half), C5 (quarter), E♭5 (quarter)
Measure 2: G4 (dotted quarter), A♭4-B♭4 (sixteenths), A♭4 (quarter), rest (quarter)
Measure 3: F5 (half), E♭5 (quarter), A♭5 (quarter)
Measure 4: E♭5 (quarter), D♭5-C5-D♭5 (eighth-sixteenth-sixteenth), C5 (quarter), rest (quarter)

The rhythmic values remain exactly the same as the original. The key signature should show 4 flats (B♭, E♭, A♭, D♭).', type='text')]
