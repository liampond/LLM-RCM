[TextBlock(text='Let me help determine the time signature by adding up the rhythmic values in each measure.

For Measure 1:
- Dotted quarter note (12 ppq)
- Eighth note (4 ppq)
- Two sixteenth notes (2 ppq each = 4 ppq)
- Eighth note (4 ppq)
- Two eighth notes (4 ppq each = 8 ppq)

Total for measure 1 = 32 ppq

For Measure 2:
- Two sixteenth notes (2 ppq each = 4 ppq)
- Two thirty-second notes (1 ppq each = 2 ppq)
- Dotted sixteenth note (3 ppq)
- Thirty-second note (1 ppq)
- Sixteenth note (2 ppq)
- Eighth note (4 ppq)
- Sixteenth note (2 ppq)

Total for measure 2 = 18 ppq

Since measure 1 has 32 ppq, and given that ppq (pulses per quarter note) is 8 in this score (as defined in the staffDef element), this means each measure contains 4 quarter notes (32รท8 = 4).

Therefore, the time signature is 4/4 (common time).', type='text')]
