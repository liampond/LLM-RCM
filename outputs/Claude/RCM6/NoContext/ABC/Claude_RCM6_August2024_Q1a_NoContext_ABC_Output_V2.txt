[TextBlock(text="I'll analyze each measure's interval between the two notes:

Measure 1: [A,g] - Augmented seventh (A7)
Measure 2: [F,B♭] - Perfect fourth (P4)
Measure 3: [E,c] - Minor sixth (m6)
Measure 4: [c,d♭] - Minor second (m2)
Measure 5: [B,f] - Diminished fifth (d5)

I've listed these intervals by measuring from the lower note to the higher note in each dyad.", type='text')]
