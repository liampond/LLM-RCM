[TextBlock(text='Let me analyze this melody:

Key:
- The key signature is Db major (indicated by K:Db)

Time Signature:
- Looking at the rhythms in each bar:
  Bar 1: A (1 eighth note)
  Bar 2: dd ff (4 eighth notes)
  Bar 3: d2 AA (4 eighth notes)
  Bar 4: A>A e/d/c/B/ (4 eighth notes)
  Bar 5: A2 (2 eighth notes to end)

Based on the consistent pattern of 4 eighth notes per complete bar (except the pickup note and final bar), this piece is in 2/4 time signature (equivalent to 4 eighth notes per bar).

Therefore:
- Key: Db major
- Time Signature: 2/4', type='text')]
