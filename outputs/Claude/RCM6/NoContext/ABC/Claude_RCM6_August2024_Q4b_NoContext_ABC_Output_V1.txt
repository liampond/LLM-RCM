[TextBlock(text="I'll help transpose this melody from E major to A flat major.

The interval from E up to A flat is a minor fourth (or augmented third).

Here's the transposed version in ABC notation:

X:1

L:1/16
M:4/4
K:Ab
V:1 treble
Ab8 c4 eb4 | Gb6 AbBb Ab4 z4 | eb8 eb4 ab4 | eb4 db2cbdb cb4 z4 ||

The changes made:
- Changed key signature from E to Ab
- E → Ab
- G → C
- B → Eb
- D → Gb
- C → Eb
- A → Db

All rhythmic values remain exactly the same as the original. The melodic contour and intervals between notes are preserved, just shifted up by a minor fourth.", type='text')]
