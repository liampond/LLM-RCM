[TextBlock(text="Looking at the ABC notation provided, I don't actually see any x-shaped noteheads or placeholder rhythms in the music. Instead, I see a piece that:

1. Starts in 4/2 time (first two measures)
2. Changes to 6/4 time (measures 3-4)
3. Changes to 9/8 time (measures 5-6)
4. Ends in 3/4 time (measures 7-8)

The piece consists entirely of F notes with various rhythmic patterns, including:
- Half notes (F3)
- Quarter notes (F2)
- Eighth notes (F/)
- Triplets ((3FFF)
- Tied notes (F<F)
- Groups of eighth notes (F/F/F/F/F)
- Dotted rhythms (F3/4)

If you'd like me to help with placing rests in specific measures, please let me know which measures need completion, as I don't see any x-shaped noteheads or incomplete measures in the current notation.", type='text')]
