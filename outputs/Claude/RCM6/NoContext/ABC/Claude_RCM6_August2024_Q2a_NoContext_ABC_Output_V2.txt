[TextBlock(text="Looking at the ABC notation provided, I don't actually see any x-shaped noteheads or placeholder rhythms in the music. The piece consists entirely of F notes with various rhythmic values and time signature changes. Here's a breakdown of what's written:

1. First measure (4/2 time): F3 F2 F/ (dotted half note, half note, eighth note)
2. Second measure: (3FFF F2 (triplet of F notes followed by a half note)
3. Time changes to 6/4: F<F F2 F3 (tied F notes, half note, dotted half note)
4. Still in 6/4: F2 F FF F2 (half note, quarter note, two eighth notes, half note)
5. Time changes to 9/8: F/FF/ F2 (eighth note, eighth note, eighth note, half note)
6. Still in 9/8: F/ F2 F F/F/F/F/F (eighth note, half note, quarter note, five eighth notes)
7. Time changes to 3/4: F2 (half note)
8. Final measure: F3/4 F2 (dotted quarter note, half note)

There are no placeholder rhythms to replace - all notes are clearly specified F notes with defined rhythmic values.", type='text')]
