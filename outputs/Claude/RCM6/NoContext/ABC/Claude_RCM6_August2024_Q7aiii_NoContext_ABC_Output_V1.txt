[TextBlock(text="Let me analyze this melody:

Key:
- The key signature shows 1 sharp (F#), which indicates the key of G major

Time Signature:
- Looking at each measure's note values:
1. z+G+A+B+c+A = 6 sixteenth notes
2. B+G+F+E+^D+A = 6 sixteenth notes
3. G/F/+E+e2+z2 = 6 sixteenth notes (the G/F/ are thirty-second notes which together make one sixteenth)
4. ^d/^c/+B+a2+z2 = 6 sixteenth notes (the ^d/^c/ are thirty-second notes which together make one sixteenth)

Since each measure consistently contains 6 sixteenth notes, this piece is in 6/16 time signature.

Therefore:
- Key: G major
- Time Signature: 6/16", type='text')]
