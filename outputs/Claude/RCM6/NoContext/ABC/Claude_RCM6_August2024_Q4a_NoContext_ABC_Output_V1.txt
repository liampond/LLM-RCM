[TextBlock(text="I'll help transpose this melody up a minor sixth from E major.

Moving up a minor sixth from E takes us to C major.
The new key signature will be C major (no sharps or flats).

Here's the transposed melody with the same rhythms:

C8 E4 G4 | B,6 CD C4 z4 | A8 G4 c4 | G4 F2EF E4 z4 ||

To break this down:

- B becomes G
- D becomes Bâ™®
- E F becomes C D
- c becomes A
- B becomes G
- e becomes c
- B becomes G
- A becomes F
- G A becomes E F
- G becomes E

All rhythmic values remain exactly the same as the original:
- Whole notes (16 sixteenth notes)
- Dotted half notes followed by two sixteenth notes
