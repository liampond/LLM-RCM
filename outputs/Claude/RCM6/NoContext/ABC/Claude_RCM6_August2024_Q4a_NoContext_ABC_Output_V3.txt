[TextBlock(text="I'll help transpose this melody up a minor sixth from E major.

A minor sixth up from E is C, so the new key will be C major.

Here's the transposed melody with the same rhythms:

C8 E4 G4 | B,6 CD C4 z4 | A8 G4 c4 | G4 F2EF E4 z4 ||

To break this down:
- E becomes C
- G becomes E
- B becomes G
- D becomes B
- F becomes D
- C becomes A
- A becomes F

The rhythms remain exactly the same as the original:
- Whole notes (8 sixteenth notes)
- Quarter notes (4 sixteenth notes)
- Dotted quarter notes (6 sixteenth notes)
- Eighth notes (2 sixteenth notes)
- Rests (z4 = quarter rest)

The new key signature would be C major (no sharps or flats).", type='text')]
