[TextBlock(text='Let me analyze the melody:

-Key: D major

-Second last chord root/quality: A major (combining E,A,C notes)
-Last chord root/quality: D major (combining F,A,D notes)

-Second last chord function: V (dominant)
-Last chord function: I (tonic)

-Cadence type: Authentic (V-I progression)

This is specifically a Perfect Authentic Cadence (PAC) since the melody ends on the root of the tonic chord (D) and the bass moves from the root of V to the root of I (A to D).', type='text')]
