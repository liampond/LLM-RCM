[TextBlock(text='Let me analyze the rhythmic content of each measure to determine the time signature:

Measure 1:
- F6 (6 sixteenths)
- F2 (2 sixteenths)
- FFF2 (4 sixteenths)
- F2F2 (4 sixteenths)
Total: 16 sixteenth notes = 4/4 time

Measure 2:
- FFF/F/ (2 sixteenths)
- F>FF (3 sixteenths)
- F2F (3 sixteenths)
Total: 8 sixteenth notes = 2/4 time

Based on this analysis, it appears that:
- Measure 1 is in 4/4 time (16 sixteenth notes)
- Measure 2 is in 2/4 time (8 sixteenth notes)

This suggests that there might be a time signature change between the measures, or one of my counts might be off. Since the music is marked with "M:none" (no time signature), we need to infer it from the rhythms present.', type='text')]
