[TextBlock(text="I'll help transpose this melody up a minor sixth from E major.

A minor sixth up from E is C, so the new key will be C major.

Here's the transposed melody with the same rhythms:

C8 E4 G4 | B,6 CD C4 z4 | A8 G4 c4 | G4 F2EF E4 z4 ||

The rhythms remain exactly the same as the original:
- Whole notes (16 sixteenth notes)
- Dotted half notes followed by two sixteenth notes
- Quarter notes
- etc.

The new key signature will be C major (no sharps or flats).

To verify:
- Original starting note E becomes C
- Original G becomes E
- Original B becomes G
- Original D becomes Bâ™­
- Original C becomes A
- Original E (high) becomes C
- Original B becomes G
- Original A becomes F
- Original G becomes E

All rhythmic values remain identical to the original.", type='text')]
