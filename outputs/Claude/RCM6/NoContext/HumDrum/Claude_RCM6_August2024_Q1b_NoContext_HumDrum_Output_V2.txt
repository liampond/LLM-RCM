[TextBlock(text='Let me help find these intervals from each note:

1. First note is B-flat (BB-X). A perfect 4th above B-flat is E-flat

2. Second note is D-sharp (D#X). A major 3rd above D-sharp is G-sharp

3. Third note is G-flat (GG-X). A diminished 8ve above G-flat is G-double-flat

4. Fourth note is C-flat (C-X). An augmented 6th above C-flat is A-natural

5. Fifth note is E-natural (EE). A minor 2nd above E is F-natural

So the answers are:
- E-flat
- G-sharp
- G-double-flat
- A-natural
- F-natural', type='text')]
