3. The chord in the first three eighth notes of bar 2 is the subdominant triad (F-Bb-D)

4. The interval between the last eighth note in bar 2 (C) and the first note in bar 3 (E) is a major third

5. The functional chord symbol for the first three eighth notes of bar 5 is I (tonic chord in F major: F-A-C)

7. The interval between the second and third eighth notes in the left hand of bar 8 (E to Bb) is a diminished fifth
