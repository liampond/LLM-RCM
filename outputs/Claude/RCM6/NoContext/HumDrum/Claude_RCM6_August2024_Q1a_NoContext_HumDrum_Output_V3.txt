[TextBlock(text="I'll analyze the intervals between the two notes in each measure:

Measure 1: A to G♯ - Major 7th

Measure 2: F♯ to B♭ - Augmented 4th

Measure 3: E to C♯ - Major 6th

Measure 4: C♭ to D - Major 2nd

Measure 5: B to F♯ - Perfect 5th

I've listed these intervals by measuring from the lower note to the higher note in each measure. Each measure contains two whole notes sounding simultaneously.", type='text')]
