[TextBlock(text='Let me analyze the melody:

-Key: D major (based on key signature of F# and C#)

-Second last chord root/quality: A major (A M)
(contains A, C#, E)

-Last chord root/quality: D major (D M)
(contains D, F#, A)

-Second last chord function: V
(A is the dominant of D)

-Last chord function: I
(D is the tonic)

-Cadence type: Authentic Cadence
(V-I progression to tonic, with melody ending on tonic note)

This is specifically a Perfect Authentic Cadence (PAC) since the melody ends on the root of the tonic chord (D) and both chords are in root position.', type='text')]
