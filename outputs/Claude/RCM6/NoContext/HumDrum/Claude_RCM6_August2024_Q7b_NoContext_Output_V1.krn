Summary:
This is a melody in A major, written in 6/8 time. The harmonic progression (F#m - Bm - C# - F#m) suggests a vi-ii-III-vi progression in A major, though the emphasis on F# minor at beginning and end could suggest F# minor as an alternative tonal center. The chromatic alterations in bar 3 (D# and E#) create a strong secondary dominant effect leading to the final F# minor chord.', type='text')]
