1. Key: Based on the key signature of 3 flats (Bb, Eb, Ab), and examining the melodic content and final cadence, this piece is in C minor.

2. Second last chord (measure before final bar):
- Root/Quality: C minor (Cm)
- Contains C, Eb, G

3. Last chord:
- Root/Quality: G major (G)
- Contains G, B natural, D

4. Functional chord symbols:
- Second last chord: i (tonic in C minor)
- Last chord: V (dominant in C minor)

5. Cadence type:
This is a Half Cadence (HC), as it moves from i to V and ends on the dominant chord (G major).

The presence of the B natural (leading tone) in the final G major chord confirms this is functioning as a dominant chord in C minor, creating a clear half cadence.', type='text')]
