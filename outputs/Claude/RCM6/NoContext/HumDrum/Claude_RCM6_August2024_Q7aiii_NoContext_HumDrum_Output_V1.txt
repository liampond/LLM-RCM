[TextBlock(text="Let me analyze this melody:

For the key:
- There is one sharp in the key signature (F#)
- This indicates the key is either G major or E minor
- Given the melodic contour and the prominence of G and B notes, this appears to be in G major

For the time signature:
- Looking at each measure's rhythmic content:
  - Measure 1: 16r + 5×16th notes = 6 sixteenth notes total
  - Measure 2: 6×16th notes = 6 sixteenth notes total
  - Measure 3: 32nd+32nd+16th+8th+8r = 6 sixteenth notes total
  - Measure 4: 32nd+32nd+16th+8th+8r = 6 sixteenth notes total

Since each measure consistently contains 6 sixteenth notes, this equals 3 eighth notes per measure.
Therefore, the time signature is 3/8.

Answer:
- Key: G major
- Time Signature: 3/8", type='text')]
