[TextBlock(text='Let me analyze the rhythmic values in each measure to determine the time signature:

Measure 1 contains:
- 4.f (dotted quarter note) = 3/8
- 8f (eighth note) = 1/8
- Two 16f (sixteenth notes) = 1/8
- 8f (eighth note) = 1/8
- Two 8f (eighth notes) = 2/8

Adding these up: 3/8 + 1/8 + 1/8 + 1/8 + 2/8 = 8/8 = 4/4

Measure 2 contains:
- Two 16f (sixteenth notes) = 1/8
- Two 32f (thirty-second notes) = 1/8
- 16.f (dotted sixteenth) + 32f = 1/8
- 16f (sixteenth note) = 1/8
- 8f (eighth note) = 1/8
- 16f (sixteenth note) = 1/8

Adding these up: 1/8 + 1/8 + 1/8 + 1/8 + 1/8 + 1/8 = 6/8

Based on this analysis, the piece appears to be in 4/4 time (common time). The first measure clearly adds up to 4/4, and while the second measure only shows 6/8 worth of notes, this could be due to the file being incomplete or cut off.

The time signature is 4/4.', type='text')]
