[TextBlock(text='Let me analyze the melody:

-Key: E-flat major (3 flats: B-flat, E-flat, A-flat)

-Second last chord (measure 4): C major (C)
Root position C with notes C, G, C, E-flat (appears as an augmented triad due to the E-flat in the melody)

-Last chord (measure 5): G major (G)
Root position G with notes G, B natural, D

-Functional symbol for second last chord: VI (or VI+) in E-flat major

-Functional symbol for last chord: III in E-flat major

-Type of cadence: Half cadence (ends on III, which functions as V/VI, creating a half cadence effect in the temporary tonicization of VI)

Note: This progression shows some chromatic harmony with the use of B natural, suggesting secondary dominant function of the final G major chord.', type='text')]
