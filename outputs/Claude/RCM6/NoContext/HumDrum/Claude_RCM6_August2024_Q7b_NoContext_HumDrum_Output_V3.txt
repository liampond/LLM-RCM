[TextBlock(text='Let me analyze this melody:

1. Key: A major (based on the key signature of F#, C#, G#)

2. Time Signature: 6/8 
(Each bar contains 6 eighth notes worth of duration, grouped in a way typical of 6/8 time - a quarter note followed by two eighth notes)

3. Chord symbols by bar:
- Bar 1: F#m (The melody outlines F#-A-C#)
- Bar 2: B minor (The melody outlines B-D-F#)
- Bar 3: C# major (The melody emphasizes C#, E#, G#)
- Bar 4: F#m (The melody sustains F#, implying a return to the tonic F#m)

Note: While the key signature suggests A major, the melody appears to be in F# minor (the relative minor of A major), as it centers around F# and uses typical minor key harmonic progressions.', type='text')]
