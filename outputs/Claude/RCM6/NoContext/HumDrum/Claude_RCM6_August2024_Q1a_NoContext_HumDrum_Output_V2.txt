[TextBlock(text="I'll analyze the intervals between the pairs of notes in each measure:

Measure 1: A4 to G5 = Major 7th

Measure 2: F#4 to Bb4 = Diminished 4th

Measure 3: E4 to C#5 = Major 6th

Measure 4: Cb5 to D5 = Major 2nd

Measure 5: B4 to F#5 = Perfect 5th

I've listed these intervals by examining the vertical sonorities in each measure, measuring from the lower note to the higher note in each case.", type='text')]
