[TextBlock(text="I'll help transpose this melody up a minor sixth and determine the new key.

Original key: E major (4 sharps: F#, C#, G#, D#)
Up a minor sixth from E takes us to C (10 semitones higher)
New key: C major (no sharps or flats)

Here's the transposed melody with precise rhythms:

The melody is now in C major. Each note has been transposed up a minor sixth while maintaining the exact same rhythm values:
- Half notes remain half notes
- Quarter notes remain quarter notes
- Dotted quarter notes remain dotted quarter notes
- Sixteenth notes remain sixteenth notes
- Rests remain unchanged

The melodic contour and all rhythmic relationships are preserved, just at the new pitch level.", type='text')]
