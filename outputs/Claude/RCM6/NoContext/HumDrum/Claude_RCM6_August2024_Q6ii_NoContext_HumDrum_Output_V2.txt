[TextBlock(text='Let me analyze this piece:

1. Key: D major (based on the key signature of F# and C#)

2. Second last chord (measure 3):
- Root/Quality: A major (notes: A, C#, E)
- Functional symbol: V

3. Last chord (measure 4):
- Root/Quality: D major (notes: F#, A, D)
- Functional symbol: I

4. Cadence type: Perfect Authentic Cadence (PAC)
- This is because it moves from V to I in root position, with the melody ending on the tonic note (D)

The progression V - I with these specific characteristics (root position chords, melody ending on tonic) creates a strong sense of resolution typical of a Perfect Authentic Cadence.', type='text')]
