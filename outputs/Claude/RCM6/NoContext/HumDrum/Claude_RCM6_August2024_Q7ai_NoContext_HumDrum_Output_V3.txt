[TextBlock(text='Let me analyze this melody:

For the key:
- There is one sharp (F#) in the key signature
- This indicates the key of G major

For the time signature:
- Looking at the rhythmic values in each measure:
- Measure 1 has a single 16th note pickup
- Measure 2 has twelve 16th notes (12/16)
- Measure 3 has eight 16th notes plus one 8th note plus another 8th note (equivalent to 12/16)
- Since each full measure contains the equivalent of 12 sixteenth notes, this indicates a time signature of 6/8
- This makes sense as 6/8 is a common compound duple meter where each measure can be divided into twelve 16th notes

Therefore:
Key: G major
Time Signature: 6/8', type='text')]
