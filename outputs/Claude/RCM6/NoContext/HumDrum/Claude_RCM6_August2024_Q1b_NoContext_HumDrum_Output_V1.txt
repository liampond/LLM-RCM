[TextBlock(text='Let me help find these intervals from each note:

1. First note is BB-X (B-flat): 
- Perfect 4th above B-flat is E-flat

2. Second note is D#X (D-sharp):
- Major 3rd above D-sharp is F-double-sharp

3. Third note is GG-X (G-flat):
- Diminished 8ve above G-flat is G-double-flat

4. Fourth note is C-X (C-flat):
- Augmented 6th above C-flat is A-natural

5. Fifth note is EE (E):
- Minor 2nd above E is F

So the answers are:
1. E-flat
2. F-double-sharp
3. G-double-flat
4. A-natural
