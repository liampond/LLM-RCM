[TextBlock(text="I'll help analyze this music and replace the quarter notes with appropriate rests to complete each bar according to the time signatures. Let's go through it measure by measure:

*M4/2 (4/2 time signature - 8 beats per measure)
Measure 1: Has 4.f + 4f + 16f = 8.5 beats, needs a half rest (2 beats) to complete

*M6/4 (6/4 time signature - 6 beats per measure)
Measures 2-4 appear complete as written

*M9/8 (9/8 time signature - 9 eighth notes per measure)
Measures 5-6 appear complete as written

*M3/4 (3/4 time signature - 3 beats per measure)
Measure 7: Has 4f = 1 beat, needs a half rest (2 beats) to complete
Measure 8: Has 16.f + 4f = 1.5 beats, needs a quarter rest + eighth rest (1.5 beats) to complete

Here are the required rests to complete each incomplete measure:
- Measure 1: Add a half rest (2 beats)
- Measure 7: Add a half rest (2 beats)
- Measure 8: Add a quarter rest + eighth rest (1.5 beats)", type='text')]
