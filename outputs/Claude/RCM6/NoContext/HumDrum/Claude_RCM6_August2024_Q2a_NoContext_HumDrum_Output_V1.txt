[TextBlock(text="I'll help analyze this music and replace the quarter notes with appropriate rests to complete each bar according to the time signatures. Let's go through it measure by measure:

*M4/2 (4/2 time signature - 8 beats per measure)
Measure 1: Has 4.f + 4f + 16f = 8.5 beats + 16th note
To complete this measure: Need a half note rest (2 beats) minus a 16th note

*M4/2
Measure 2: Has 12f+12f+12f (= 1 beat) + 4f (= 2 beats)
To complete this measure: Need a whole note rest + half note rest (6 beats)

*M6/4 (6/4 time signature - 6 beats per measure)
Measure 3: Has 16f+8.f (= 1 beat) + 4f (= 2 beats) + 4.f (= 3 beats)
To complete this measure: No rests needed - measure is complete

*M6/4
Measure 4: Has 4f + 8f + 8f+8f + 4f = 6 beats
This measure is complete - no rests needed

*M9/8 (9/8 time signature - 9 eighth notes per measure)
Measure 5: Has 16f+8f+16f + 4f = 5 eighth notes
To complete this measure: Need 4 eighth rests

*M9/8
Measure 6: Has 16f+4f+8f + 16f+16f+16f+16f+8f = 9 eighth notes
This measure is complete - no rests needed

*M3/4 (3/4 time signature - 3 beats per measure)
Measure 7: Has 4f = 1 beat
To complete this measure: Need a half note rest (2 beats)

*M3/4
Measure 8: Has 16.f + 4f = 2.25 beats
To complete this measure: Need a quarter rest minus a 16th note (0.75 beats)", type='text')]
