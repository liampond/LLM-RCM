Original key: E major (4 sharps: F#, C#, G#, D#)
Up a minor sixth from E takes us to C (10 semitones higher)
New key: C major (no sharps or flats)

- Half notes remain half notes
- Quarter notes remain quarter notes
- Dotted quarter notes remain dotted quarter notes
- Sixteenth notes remain sixteenth notes
- Rests remain rests

The beaming and grouping of notes has been preserved as in the original.", type='text')]
