I've maintained all the original rhythmic values and contours while shifting each pitch up by a perfect fourth. The key signature has changed from 4 sharps (E major) to 4 flats (A flat major). All accidentals and rhythmic patterns remain exactly as they were in the original, just transposed up a P4.", type='text')]
