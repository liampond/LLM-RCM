**Key Analysis:**

1. **Key Signature:** The key signature is G major (one sharp - F#).

2. **Major or Minor:**  There are no accidentals present that suggest a raised 7th degree. The piece is likely in G major.

3. **Other Clues:** The piece emphasizes G major chords and the final note is G, supporting the conclusion that the key is G major.

**Time Signature Analysis:**

1. **Identify the Beat Groupings:** The music is written in 1/16th note durations.  The notes are grouped as follows:

* `gbf` (three 16th notes)
* `gbd` (three 16th notes)
* `gbf` (three 16th notes)
* `gbd` (three 16th notes)
* `ecG` (three 16th notes)
* `g2` (a dotted eighth note, equivalent to three 16th notes)
* `dBG` (three 16th notes)
* `g2` (a dotted eighth note, equivalent to three 16th notes)

2. **Check the Total Value of the Beam Groupings:** Each group consists of three 16th notes, totaling 0.75 beats (3 * 0.25). This suggests a compound meter. Since the smallest division is a sixteenth note, the bottom number of the time signature will be 16.

3. **Count the Total Beats in the Measure:** There are eight groups of three 16th notes each.  Therefore, there are 8 * 3 = 24 sixteenth notes in the measure.

4. **Write the Time Signature:** Since the bottom number is 16 and there are 24 sixteenth notes, the time signature is 24/16. This can be simplified to 6/4 by dividing both numbers by 4.  While 24/16 would be technically correct, 6/4 is the more conventional way to represent this rhythmic structure.

**Summary:**

The key of the piece is G major and the time signature is 6/4.
