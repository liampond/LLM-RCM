**Key Analysis:**

1. **Key Signature:** The key signature is Db, indicating either Db Major or Bb minor.

2. **Major or Minor:**  There are no accidentals present that would clearly indicate a raised 7th degree in Bb minor (i.e., an A natural). The given melody emphasizes the Db major triad (Db-F-Ab).

3. **Other Clues:** The piece starts and ends on a Db chord (implied), suggesting Db Major.

**Time Signature Analysis:**

1. **Identify Beat Groupings:** The music uses eighth notes and quarter notes. The beaming suggests groupings of two eighth notes (dd, ff) or a single quarter note (d2, A2).

2. **Check Total Value:** Each beamed group (two eighth notes or one quarter note) equals one quarter note (1.0). This suggests simple time. Since one beat equals a quarter note, the bottom number of the time signature will be 4.

3. **Count Total Beats:**
* Measure 1: dd (1 beat) + ff (1 beat) = 2 beats
* Measure 2: d2 (1 beat) + AA (1 beat) = 2 beats
* Measure 3: A>A (1 beat) + e/d/c/B/ (1 beat) = 2 beats
* Measure 4: A2 (1 beat) = 1 beat (incomplete measure)

The consistent beat grouping suggests a time signature with 2 beats per bar. The final bar is an incomplete bar, common in music.

4. **Write Time Signature:** The time signature is 2/4.

**Summary:**

The key of the given piece is Db Major, and the time signature is 2/4.
