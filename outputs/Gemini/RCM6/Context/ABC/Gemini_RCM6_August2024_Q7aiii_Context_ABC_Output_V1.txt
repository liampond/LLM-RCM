**Key Analysis:**

1. **Key Signature:** The key signature is G major (one sharp - F#).

2. **Major or Minor:**  There is an accidental ^D (D sharp) in the second bar and ^C (C sharp) and ^d (d sharp) in the fourth bar. These accidentals are not part of the G major scale. However, they don't clearly indicate E minor (the relative minor of G major) either, as the characteristic raised 7th degree of E minor (D#) appears only briefly.  While the piece uses notes outside of G major, the absence of a consistent leading tone towards E suggests that G major is the most likely key.

3. **Other Clues:** The piece begins and ends with G, the tonic of G major. The melodic contour and harmonies, while containing chromaticism, don't strongly suggest a minor key.

**Time Signature Analysis:**

1. **Identify Beat Groupings:** The music uses 16th notes as the smallest unit. Notes are not beamed together, implying each 16th note receives a beat.

2. **Total Value of Beam Groupings:** Since each 16th note is treated as a beat, the time signature is simple.  A 16th note has a value of 1/16, so the bottom number of the time signature will be 16.

3. **Total Beats in the Measure:**  The first bar contains 8 sixteenth notes: G A B c A | B G F. The second bar also contains 8 sixteenth notes: E ^D A | G /F/ E. The third bar contains 8 sixteenth notes: e2 z2. The fourth bar contains 8 sixteenth notes: ^d/^c/Ba2 z2. Therefore, each measure contains 8 sixteenth notes.

4. **Write the Time Signature:** The top number is 8 (total 16th notes per measure), and the bottom number is 16. The time signature is 8/16.  This could be simplified to 4/8 or even 2/4, but given the explicit use of 16th notes throughout and the absence of beaming to suggest groupings, 8/16 is the most accurate representation.

**Summary:**

Key: G major
Time Signature: 8/16
