**Key and Time Signature:**

1. **Key Signature:** The key signature is A major (K:A).  There are no accidentals present that suggest a minor key. Therefore, the key is A major.

2. **Time Signature:**
   - Bar 1: `f2 c ABc` (half, quarter, eighth, eighth, eighth, eighth = 2 + 1 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 = 5 eighth notes)
   - Bar 2: `d2 B fed` (half, quarter, eighth, eighth, eighth, eighth = 5 eighth notes)
   - Bar 3: `c^d^e gfe` (eighth, eighth, eighth, eighth, eighth, eighth = 3 eighth notes)
   - Bar 4: `f6` (dotted half note = 3 eighth notes)

Since the piece uses eighth notes as its smallest division and groups them primarily in twos (implied by the half and quarter notes), it suggests a simple time signature. The most common time signature that accommodates 5 eighth notes is 5/8.  However, bar 3 and 4 only have 3 beats.  The closest time signature would be 3/4.  However, given the mixed number of beats per bar, it is most likely that the composer intended a time signature of 5/8 for bars 1 and 2, and 3/4 for bars 3 and 4.  This is a common technique in 19th and 20th century music.

**Chord Analysis:**

- **Bar 1:** `f2 c ABc` suggests an **F major** chord. The notes A, B, and C can be interpreted as a passing tone, leading tone, and the root of the next implied chord.
- **Bar 2:** `d2 B fed` suggests a **D major** chord. The notes B, f, e, and d outline a D major chord with a passing tone (B) and a stepwise descent.
- **Bar 3:** `c^d^e gfe` suggests an **E major** chord. The raised c and d create a chromatic approach to the e, which is the root of the chord. The g and f are the fifth and seventh of the chord, respectively.
- **Bar 4:** `f6` suggests an **F major** chord.  This bar contains only the note F, which is the root of the F major chord.

**Summary:**

The piece is in A major. The time signature is irregular, alternating between 5/8 and 3/4. The implied chords are: F major, D major, E major, and F major.
