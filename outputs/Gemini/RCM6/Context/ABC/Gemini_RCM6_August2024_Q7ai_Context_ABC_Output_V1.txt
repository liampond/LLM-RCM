**Key Analysis:**

1. **Key Signature:** The key signature is G major (one sharp - F#).

2. **Major or Minor:**  There are no accidentals present that suggest a raised 7th degree. The piece is likely in G major.

3. **Other Clues:** The piece emphasizes notes within the G major scale. While a more complete piece would offer stronger harmonic evidence, the given excerpt doesn't contradict G major.

**Time Signature Analysis:**

1. **Identify Beat Groupings:** The notes are primarily grouped as individual 16th notes or pairs of 16th notes.  There's also a half note (g2) and a dotted quarter note (g2c - where the c is a separate 16th note).

2. **Total Value of Beam Groupings:**  Since the smallest unit is a 16th note (1/16), let's calculate the total duration of the first bar:

   * `gbf gbd gbf gbd`: Eight 16th notes = 8 * (1/16) = 1/2
   * `ecG`: Three 16th notes = 3 * (1/16) = 3/16
   * `g2`: A half note = 8/16 = 1/2
   * `c`: A 16th note = 1/16
   * `dBG`: Three 16th notes = 3/16
   * `g2`: A half note = 1/2

   Total: 1/2 + 3/16 + 1/2 + 1/16 + 3/16 + 1/2 = 24/16 = 3/2

3. **Determine Bottom Number:** The rhythmic groupings suggest a simple meter.  If we consider a dotted quarter note as a beat unit (common in compound meters), the first bar adds up to two dotted quarter notes (3/8 + 3/8 = 6/8 = 3/4, and the second bar adds up to two dotted quarter notes as well.  Thus, the bottom number could be 8, representing an eighth note as one beat in a compound meter.

4. **Count Total Beats:**  In the first bar, there are six eighth-note beats.  In the second bar, there are also six eighth-note beats.

5. **Write Time Signature:**  Given the groupings and total duration, the time signature is likely 6/8.

**Summary:**

The key of the given music excerpt is G major. The time signature, inferred from the rhythmic values, is 6/8.
