**Key Analysis:**

1. **Key Signature:** The key signature is G major (one sharp - F#).

2. **Major or Minor:**  While the key signature suggests G major, the piece uses the notes ^d, ^c, and B frequently. The raised ^c suggests a tendency towards the relative minor, E minor.  The piece ends on B, the dominant of E minor.  These observations strongly suggest E minor.

3. **Other Clues:** The piece emphasizes the E minor triad (E, G, B) melodically.  The presence of the raised ^c (the leading tone of E minor) further supports the conclusion that the piece is in E minor.

**Time Signature Analysis:**

1. **Identify the Beat Groupings:** The music is written in 1/16th note increments.  Let's analyze the groupings:

* `z GABcA`:  Six sixteenth notes.
* `BGFE^DA`: Seven sixteenth notes.
* `G/F/Ee2`:  A sixteenth note, followed by two tied sixteenth notes (equal to a dotted eighth), followed by a half note (equal to eight sixteenth notes). Total: 1 + 2 + 8 = 11 sixteenth notes.
* `^d/^c/Ba2`: A sixteenth note, followed by two tied sixteenth notes (equal to a dotted eighth), followed by a half note (equal to eight sixteenth notes). Total: 1 + 2 + 8 = 11 sixteenth notes.

2. **Check the Total Value:** The groupings do not fall neatly into simple or compound time.  However, the consistent use of sixteenth notes and dotted eighth note figures suggests a compound meter feel.  The total number of sixteenth notes per measure is 6 + 7 + 11 + 11 = 35.

3. **Irregular Meter:** Since 35 cannot be divided evenly by 2, 3, or 4, we can infer that the piece is in an irregular meter.  The closest compound time signature would be 12/16, but the measures consistently exceed this.  The groupings suggest a fluctuating meter, not a consistent time signature.

**Summary:**

Key: E minor
Time Signature:  The piece is best described as being in an irregular meter due to the fluctuating number of sixteenth notes per measure.  It does not conform to a standard time signature.
