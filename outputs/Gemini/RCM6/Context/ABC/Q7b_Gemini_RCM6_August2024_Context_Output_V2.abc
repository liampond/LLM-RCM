**Key:**

1. **Key Signature:** The key signature has no sharps or flats. This suggests C Major or A Minor.

2. **Major or Minor:**  The piece uses C, B, A frequently, and there is a G natural in bar 3.  The raised 7th of A minor is G#. Since there is no G#, and the notes strongly outline a C major scale, the key is C Major.

**Time Signature:**

1. **Identify Beat Groupings:** Notes are grouped in twos (e.g., "f2," "c2") and threes (e.g., A, B, c).  The piece has an overall feel of 6/8.

2. **Total Value of Beam Groupings:**  Each eighth note = 0.5 of a beat.  Two eighth notes beamed together = 1 beat.  Three eighth notes beamed together = 1.5 beats.  This suggests a compound meter.

3. **Beat Value:**  The smallest division is an eighth note (1/8).  The beaming suggests that a dotted quarter note (equal to three eighth notes) represents one beat.

4. **Total Beats:** Each bar contains 6 eighth notes, or two dotted quarter notes.  This confirms 6/8.

**Chord Symbols:**

* **Bar 1:** F major chord (F2 c ABc). The notes F, A, and C are prominent.
* **Bar 2:** G major chord (d2 B fed). The notes G, B, and D are prominent.
* **Bar 3:** C major chord (c^d^e gfe). The notes C, E, and G are prominent.
* **Bar 4:** F major chord (f6). The note F is sustained.

**Summary:**
