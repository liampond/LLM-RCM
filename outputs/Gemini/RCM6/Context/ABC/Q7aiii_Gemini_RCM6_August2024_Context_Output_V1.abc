**Key Analysis:**

1. **Key Signature:** The key signature is G major (one sharp - F#).

2. **Major or Minor:**  There is an accidental ^D (D sharp) in the second bar and ^d and ^c (D sharp and C sharp) in the fourth bar. These accidentals are not part of the G major scale. However, they don't clearly indicate E minor (relative minor of G major) either, as the raised 7th in E minor would be D#.  The piece doesn't strongly emphasize minor chords or progressions.

3. **Other Clues:** The piece begins and ends on G, suggesting G major.

**Time Signature Analysis:**

1. **Identify Beat Groupings:** The music uses 16th notes as the smallest unit.  The beaming groups notes as follows:

* Bar 1:  G A B c A  | B G F E ^D A |
* Bar 2: G/F/E e2 z2 | ^d/^c/B a2 z2 ||

2. **Check Total Value of Beam Groupings:**  Each beamed group contains a total duration of a quarter note (4/16). This suggests simple time.

3. **Count Total Beats:** Each bar contains two quarter notes worth of beamed notes, plus two half notes worth of rests (z2). This totals 4 quarter notes per bar.

4. **Write Time Signature:**  The time signature is 4/4.

**Summary:**

The key of the piece is G major. The time signature is 4/4.
