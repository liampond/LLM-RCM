**1. Key Identification**

* **Key Signature:** The key signature is Db, indicating either Db Major or Bb minor.
* **Raised 7th:**  There's no B natural (the raised 7th in Bb minor) present in the melody.
* **Conclusion:** The key is Db Major.

**2. Time Signature Identification**

* **Step 1: Identify the Beat Groupings:**
    * `dd ff`: Two eighth notes (d) beamed together, followed by two eighth notes (f) beamed together.  Each grouping has a total rhythmic value of one quarter note (1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2).
    * `d2`: One half note. This has a rhythmic value of a half note (2/4).
    * `AA`: Two quarter notes (A) beamed together. This has a rhythmic value of a half note (1/2 + 1/2 = 1).
    * `A>A e/d/c/B/`: A dotted quarter note (A), followed by four sixteenth notes (e, d, c, B). This grouping has a rhythmic value of one quarter note + one quarter note = a half note.
    * `A2`: One half note. This has a rhythmic value of a half note (2/4).

* **Step 2 & 3: Determine Bottom and Top Number:** Each beamed group adds up to a half note.  Since the piece uses eighth notes, we can infer that two eighth notes make up one beat. Therefore, the bottom number of the time signature is 2 (representing a half note beat).  The first bar contains two such groupings, totaling one whole note. The second bar contains two half notes, totaling one whole note. The third bar contains two half notes, totaling one whole note. The fourth bar is empty. Thus, the top number is 2.

* **Step 4: Write the Time Signature:** The time signature is 2/2.

**Summary**

The key of the music is Db Major, and the time signature is 2/2.
