The ABC notation explicitly states `M:none`, indicating no time signature is specified.  However, analyzing the rhythms reveals the implied meter:

**Measure 1:**

* `F6` (F dotted half note) = 3 quarter notes
* `F2` (F half note) = 2 quarter notes
* `FFF2` (FFF half note) = 2 quarter notes
* `F2F2` (F half, F half) = 2 + 2 = 4 quarter notes

Total: 3 + 2 + 2 + 4 = 11 quarter notes

**Measure 2:**

* `FFF/F/` (F dotted quarter, F dotted quarter) = 1.5 + 1.5 = 3 quarter notes
* `F>FF` (F dotted eighth, FF sixteenth) = .75 + .25 = 1 quarter note
* `F2F2` (F half, F half) = 2 + 2 = 4 quarter notes

Total: 3 + 1 + 4 = 8 quarter notes

**Conclusion:**

While the total durations differ between the measures, the beaming and rhythmic groupings suggest an irregular meter.  Since no time signature is given, it's most accurate to describe the piece as having no fixed time signature or as being in free time.  One could potentially interpret the first measure as 11/4 and the second as 8/4, but given the context and the explicit `M:none`, this is less likely the composer's intent. It's more probable the composer wanted the performer to feel the rhythms intuitively without a strict metrical framework.
