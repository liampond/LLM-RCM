**Key Analysis:**

1. **Key Signature:** The key signature is G major (one sharp - F#).

2. **Major or Minor:**  There are no accidentals present that suggest a raised 7th degree. The piece is likely in G major.

3. **Other Clues:** The piece emphasizes G major chords and harmonies.

**Time Signature Analysis:**

1. **Identify the Beat Groupings:** The music is written in 16th notes.  The beaming suggests the following groupings:

* `gbf` (16th, 16th, 16th)
* `gbd` (16th, 16th, 16th)
* `gbf` (16th, 16th, 16th)
* `gbd` (16th, 16th, 16th)
* `ecG` (16th, 16th, 16th)
* `g2` (half note = 8 * 16th)
* `c` (16th)
* `dBG` (16th, 16th, 16th)
* `g2` (half note = 8 * 16th)

2. **Check the Total Value:** Each beamed group of three 16th notes adds up to 3/16 or a dotted eighth note. This suggests a compound meter.

3. **Count the Total Beats:**  There are a total of 32 sixteenth notes in the two bars. Since the beaming suggests groupings of 3, we can infer a time signature with a bottom number of 16.  32/16 suggests a possible time signature of 32/16, which can be simplified to 2/1. However, the beaming suggests compound time.  If we consider each group of three 16th notes as one beat, we have the following beat count:

* Bar 1: 4 groups of 3 sixteenths = 12 sixteenths.
* Bar 2: 2 groups of 3 sixteenths + 2 half notes (each equivalent to 8 sixteenths) + 1 sixteenth = 20 sixteenths.

Given the irregular phrasing, the time signature is best represented as a compound time signature of 12/16 (simplified to 3/4) for the first bar and 5/4 for the second bar.

**Summary:**

The key of the piece is G major. The time signature is irregular, with the first bar in 3/4 and the second bar in 5/4.
