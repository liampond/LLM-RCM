**Key Signature Analysis:**

1. **Key Signature:** The key signature is *k[f#c#g#], indicating three sharps.

2. **Major or Minor:**  Consulting the table, three sharps suggest either A major or F# minor. The piece prominently features C#'s, which is the leading tone (raised 7th degree) of F# minor. Therefore, the key is F# minor.

**Time Signature Analysis:**

1. **Identify Beat Groupings:** The beaming suggests groupings of 3 eighth notes.  For example, the first measure has: (4ff# = two eighth notes tied) + (8cc#) + (8aL) + (8b) + (8cc#J = two eighth notes tied) = 6 eighth notes or 3 beats.

2. **Determine Bottom Number:** Each beat has the value of a dotted quarter note (3 eighth notes). In compound time signatures, the bottom number represents the division of the beat. Since the beat is divided into eighth notes, the bottom number is 8.

3. **Count Beats:** Each measure contains 6 eighth notes, equivalent to two dotted quarter notes. Thus, there are two beats per measure.

4. **Time Signature:** The time signature is 6/8.

**Chord Analysis:**

* **Bar 1:** F# (tonic), C# (V), A (iii) implies **F#m**.

* **Bar 2:** D (VI), B (iv), F# (i) implies **Dm**.  Although the F# is in the next bar, the leap from B clearly targets the F#, and the overall harmonic context supports Dm.

* **Bar 3:** C# (V), E# (=F) (vii°), G# (ii) implies **C#dim**. This diminished chord functions as vii° in F# minor.

* **Bar 4:** F# (tonic) sustained implies **F#m**.

**Summary:**

* Key: F# minor
* Time Signature: 6/8
* Bar 1: F#m
* Bar 2: Dm
* Bar 3: C#dim
* Bar 4: F#m
