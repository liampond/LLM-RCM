- Key: F minor (one flat in the key signature, and the piece uses A naturals, which is the raised 7th degree of F minor)
- Time Signature: 3/4 (Each bar consists of three quarter notes worth of music. Each beamed group of eighth notes adds up to a quarter note. Thus, the eighth notes are simply subdivisions of the main beat.)
- Chord in bar 2: Subdominant triad (The notes F, A♭, and C outline a D♭ major chord, which is the subdominant chord in F minor.)
- Interval between bar 2 and 3: Perfect octave (C to C)
- Functional chord symbol in bar 5: V (The notes C, E♭, and G outline a C minor chord, which is the dominant chord in F minor.  It is minor v in lower case because the piece is in minor.)
- Chord in bar 7: Submediant triad (The notes A♭, C, and E♭ outline an A♭ major chord, which is the submediant chord in F minor.)
- Interval in bar 8: Major third (B♭ to D)
- Rest in bar 8: Quarter rest (A quarter rest is needed to complete the 3/4 time signature.)
- Period type: Parallel period (Both phrases begin with nearly identical melodic material in the right hand: F-A-C-F-A-C.)
- Allegretto vivace: A tempo marking indicating a moderately fast tempo with a lively and brisk character.  "Allegretto" means moderately fast, and "vivace" adds the sense of liveliness.

Summary:
The piece is in F minor and 3/4 time. It features predominantly subdominant and dominant harmonies and has a parallel periodic structure. The tempo is allegretto vivace, suggesting a moderately fast and lively character.
