**1. Key Signature Analysis:**

* The key signature is `*k[f#]`, indicating one sharp.  According to the table, this suggests either G major or E minor.

**2. Determining Major or Minor:**

* The music contains d#X (double sharp). While E minor has one sharp (F#), the D# strongly suggests a raised leading tone, but not in E minor.  A double sharp is not diatonic to E minor.

* G major has F# as its only sharp. D# is the raised 7th degree of G major (before resolving to G). This strongly suggests G major.

**3. Time Signature Analysis:**

* **Step 1: Identify the Beat Groupings:**  The music uses 16th notes, 32nd notes, and eighth notes beamed together in varying combinations. Let's analyze the first two bars:

    * Bar 1:
        * `16r` (rest) = 0.25 beats
        * `16gLL` = 0.75 beats (three 16ths)
        * `16a` = 0.25 beats
        * `16b` = 0.25 beats
        * `16cc` = 0.5 beats (two 16ths)
        * `16aJJ` = 0.75 beats (three 16ths)
        * Total: 2.75 beats

    * Bar 2:
        * `16bLL` = 0.75 beats
        * `16g` = 0.25 beats
        * `16f#` = 0.25 beats
        * `16e` = 0.25 beats
        * `16d#X` = 0.25 beats
        * `16aJJ` = 0.75 beats
        * Total: 2.5 beats

* **Irregular groupings:** The varying total beat values for each measure (2.75, 2.5) indicate an irregular meter.  This is further confirmed by the presence of a measure with a single eighth rest (worth 0.5 beats).  The piece is likely in a changing or irregular time signature, not a standard one.  While we can analyze the rhythmic groupings, assigning a single time signature is not possible.

**Summary:**

The key of the piece is G major. The time signature is irregular and cannot be definitively identified as a standard time signature due to the varying rhythmic groupings within each measure.
