**Key Determination:**

1. **Check the Key Signature:** The key signature is `*k[f#]`, indicating one sharp.  According to the table, one sharp corresponds to G major or E minor.

2. **Determine Major or Minor:** The music contains d#X (double sharp).  While E minor has one sharp (f#), it does *not* include d#; thus, the presence of d#X strongly suggests that the piece is not in E minor. Therefore, the key is G major.

3. **Other Clues:**  While not strictly necessary given the strong evidence above, the piece begins and ends with G, the tonic of G major, further supporting the conclusion.


**Time Signature Determination:**

1. **Identify the Beat Groupings:** The music contains the following rhythmic groupings:

* Group 1: 16r, 16gLL, 16a, 16b, 16cc, 16aJJ
* Group 2: 16bLL, 16g, 16f#, 16e, 16d#X, 16aJJ
* Group 3: 32gLLL, 32f#J, 16eJ, 8eeJ, 8r
* Group 4: 32dd#XLLL, 32cc#XJ, 16bJ, 8aaJ, 8r

2. **Check the Total Value of the Beam Groupings:**

* Group 1: Six sixteenth notes = 6 * 0.25 = 1.5 beats.  This suggests a compound meter.
* Group 2: Six sixteenth notes = 6 * 0.25 = 1.5 beats.
* Group 3: Three sixteenth notes (32gLLL is equivalent to three tied sixteenth notes) + two sixteenth notes (32f#J and 16eJ) + two eighth notes (8eeJ) + one eighth rest = 3 * 0.25 + 2 * 0.25 + 2 * 0.5 + 0.5 = 0.75 + 0.5 + 1 + 0.5 = 2.75.  Since the other groups suggest compound meter, we can interpret this as containing nine sixteenth notes.
* Group 4: Three sixteenth notes + two sixteenth notes + one eighth note + two eighth notes + one eighth rest = 3 * 0.25 + 2 * 0.25 + 0.5 + 1 + 0.5 = 0.75 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 1 + 0.5 = 3.25.  Again, interpreting in compound meter, this is equivalent to nine sixteenth notes.

3. **Count the Total Beats in the Measure:** Each group contains the equivalent of 9 sixteenth notes.  Since the meter is compound, each beat consists of three sixteenth notes.  Therefore, each group contains 9/3 = 3 beats.

4. **Write the Time Signature:**  Each measure contains two rhythmic groups, each with three beats.  Therefore, the time signature is 6/8.

**Summary:**

The key of the given piece is G major. The time signature is 6/8.
