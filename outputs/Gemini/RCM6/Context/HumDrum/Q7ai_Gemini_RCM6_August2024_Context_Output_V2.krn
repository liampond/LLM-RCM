**Key Signature Analysis:**

1. **Check the Key Signature:** The key signature is `*k[f#]`, indicating one sharp.

2. **Major or Minor Key:**  The key signature suggests either G major or E minor. The music contains no g# (the raised 7th for E minor). This points towards G major.

3. **Other Clues:** The piece predominantly uses notes within the G major scale.

**Time Signature Analysis:**

1. **Identify the Beat Groupings:** The music contains consistent groupings of sixteenth notes.  Let's analyze the first measure:

    * `16dd`: Two sixteenth notes (0.25 + 0.25 = 0.5)
    * `16ggLL`: Two sixteenth notes tied to two more (0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 = 1)
    * `16bb`: Two sixteenth notes (0.25 + 0.25 = 0.5)
    * `16ff#JJ`: Two sixteenth notes tied to two more (0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 = 1)
    * `16ggLL`: Two sixteenth notes tied to two more (0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 = 1)
    * `16bb`: Two sixteenth notes (0.25 + 0.25 = 0.5)
    * `16ddJJ`: Two sixteenth notes tied to two more (0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 = 1)
    * `16ggLL`: Two sixteenth notes tied to two more (0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 = 1)
    * `16bb`: Two sixteenth notes (0.25 + 0.25 = 0.5)
    * `16ff#JJ`: Two sixteenth notes tied to two more (0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 = 1)
    * `16ggLL`: Two sixteenth notes tied to two more (0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 = 1)
    * `16bb`: Two sixteenth notes (0.25 + 0.25 = 0.5)
    * `16ddJJ`: Two sixteenth notes tied to two more (0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 = 1)

2. **Check the Total Value:** The groupings alternate between 0.5 and 1, suggesting simple time.  The most common rhythmic value within the beamed groupings is a quarter note (1).

3. **Count the Total Beats:**  Adding the values of the groupings in the first measure: 0.5 + 1 + 0.5 + 1 + 1 + 0.5 + 1 + 1 + 0.5 + 1 + 1 + 0.5 + 1 = 10

4. **Write the Time Signature:** Since the beat unit is a quarter note (1) and there are 10 beats per measure, the time signature is 10/4.

**Summary:**

The key of the piece is G major. The time signature is 10/4.
