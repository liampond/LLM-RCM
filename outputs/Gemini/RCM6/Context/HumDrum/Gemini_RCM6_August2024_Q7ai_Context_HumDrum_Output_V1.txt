**1. Key Signature Analysis:**

*   The key signature is `*k[f#]`, indicating one sharp.  According to the table, one sharp corresponds to G major or E minor.

**2. Determining Major or Minor:**

*   The music contains no accidentals outside of the key signature. This strongly suggests the piece is in G major.

**3. Time Signature Analysis:**

*   **Step 1: Identify the Beat Groupings:** The music primarily features groups of four sixteenth notes (e.g., `16dd`, `16ggLL`).  Some groups have a dotted eighth note followed by a sixteenth note (e.g. `8ggL` followed by `16ccJk`).
*   **Step 2 & 3: Check Total Value and Count Beats:** Each group of four sixteenth notes equals one quarter note (16 + 16 + 16 + 16 = 64 = 1 quarter note).  A dotted eighth note plus a sixteenth note also equals one quarter note (0.75 + 0.25 = 1).  The first measure contains four groups of sixteenth notes, totaling one whole note (or four quarter notes).  The second measure also contains four such groups.
*   **Step 4: Write the Time Signature:** Since the music is grouped into four quarter notes per measure, the time signature is 4/4.

**Summary:**

The key of the piece is G major, and the time signature is 4/4.
