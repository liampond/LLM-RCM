**Key and Time Signature Identification**

1. **Key Signature:** The key signature is `*k[f#c#g#]`, indicating three sharps.  According to the table, this suggests either A major or F# minor.

2. **Major or Minor:** The piece uses E# (enharmonically equivalent to F) and D# (present in bar 2).  E# is the raised 7th degree of F# minor. This strongly suggests the key is **F# minor**.

3. **Time Signature:**
    * Each bar contains the equivalent of six eighth notes.
    * The beaming pattern suggests groupings of 3 eighth notes (e.g., a quarter note followed by two eighth notes). This suggests a compound meter.
    * Given six eighth notes per bar and a compound meter, the time signature is **6/8**.

**Chord Analysis**

* **Bar 1:** F# (downbeat), C# (second beat), A (offbeat). This outlines an **F# minor (F#m)** chord.

* **Bar 2:** D (downbeat), B (second beat), F# (offbeat), E (offbeat), D (offbeat). The primary notes are D, B, and F#, forming a **D major (D)** chord.

* **Bar 3:** C# (downbeat), D# (second beat), E# (offbeat), G# (offbeat), F# (offbeat), E# (offbeat). The most prominent notes suggest a **C# diminished (C#dim)** chord.

* **Bar 4:** F# (downbeat, held for two beats). This clearly points to an **F# minor (F#m)** chord.
