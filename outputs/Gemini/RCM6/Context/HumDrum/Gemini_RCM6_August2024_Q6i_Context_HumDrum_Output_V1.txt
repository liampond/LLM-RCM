Here's the analysis of the melody:

* **Key:** C minor (Three flats in the key signature, and the piece emphasizes C minor tonality)

* **Root/Quality Chord Symbol of the Second Last Chord:**  G (G major)

* **Root/Quality Chord Symbol of the Last Chord:** Cm (C minor)

* **Functional Chord Symbol for the Second Last Chord:** V

* **Functional Chord Symbol for the Last Chord:** i

* **Type of Cadence:** Authentic

**Explanation and Step-by-Step Breakdown:**

1. **Key:** The key signature has three flats (B♭, E♭, A♭), indicating either E♭ major or C minor.  The consistent use of E♭ throughout the melody and the final cadence point strongly towards C minor.

2. **Second to Last Chord:** The penultimate chord has G in the bass, a B natural (creating a major third above G), and a D (a perfect fifth above G). This forms a G major chord.

3. **Last Chord:** The final chord has C in the bass, an E♭ (a minor third above C), and a G (a perfect fifth above C). This forms a C minor chord.

4. **Functional Harmony:** In C minor:
    * G major is the dominant chord (V)
    * C minor is the tonic chord (i)

5. **Cadence:** The progression from V to i is a classic authentic cadence.
