**Key Analysis:**

1. **Key Signature:** The key signature is `*k[b-e-a-d-g-]`, indicating five flats.

2. **Major/Minor:**  According to the table, five flats correspond to D♭ Major or B♭ minor.  There are no accidentals present in the music that would indicate a raised 7th degree. This suggests the key is likely D♭ Major.

3. **Other Clues:** While the excerpt is short, the first and last notes are both A♭, the tonic of D♭ Major. This further supports the conclusion that the key is D♭ Major.

**Time Signature Analysis:**

1. **Identify Beat Groupings:** The music contains the following rhythmic groupings:

* Group 1: Eighth rest, two eighth notes tied.
* Group 2: Two eighth notes tied, eighth rest.
* Group 3: Quarter note tied, eighth rest.
* Group 4: Dotted eighth note tied, sixteenth note, two sixteenth notes tied, sixteenth note, sixteenth note, two sixteenth notes tied.
* Group 5: Quarter note.

2. **Check Total Value:**

* Group 1: 0.5 + 1 = 1.5
* Group 2: 1 + 0.5 = 1.5
* Group 3: 1 + 0.5 = 1.5
* Group 4: 0.75 + 0.25 + 0.5 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.5 = 2.5 (This group seems problematic, as it doesn't fit the pattern.  However, notice that the final two tied sixteenth notes cross the barline.  If we consider only the notes before the barline, we have 0.75 + 0.25 + 0.5 + 0.25 + 0.25 = 1.5)
* Group 5: 1

Groups 1, 2, and the corrected Group 4 suggest a compound meter, with each beat consisting of three eighth notes (1.5 beats). Group 3 also fits this pattern. Group 5, however, does not initially appear to fit.

3. **Count Total Beats:**  If we consider the primary beat value as a dotted quarter note (three eighth notes), the first measure contains two such beats (1.5 + 1.5 = 3, equivalent to two dotted quarter notes). The second measure also contains two dotted quarter beats (1.5 + 0.5 (of the tied sixteenth notes) + 1 = 3).

4. **Write Time Signature:** Since the primary beat is a dotted quarter note, the bottom number of the time signature will be 8 (as a dotted quarter note is equivalent to three eighth notes). Each measure contains two dotted quarter notes worth of rhythmic value, so the top number is 2.  This gives us a time signature of 6/8.

**Summary:**

The key of the music is D♭ Major. The time signature is 6/8.
