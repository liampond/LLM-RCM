- **Key:** F# Major (1 sharp in the key signature)
- **Time Signature:** 6/8 (Each beamed group of eighth notes adds up to a dotted quarter note (1.5 beats). There are four dotted quarter notes worth of notes in each bar. 1.5 * 4 = 6. The eighth note gets the 8 in the time signature.)
- **Chord (Bar 2):** Supertonic triad (The notes F#, B, and D form a D major chord, which is the supertonic chord in F# major)
- **Interval (Bar 2-3):** Augmented Fourth (C to B# is an augmented fourth)
- **Functional Chord Symbol (Bar 5):** I (Tonic chord in F# major is F# major)
- **Chord (Bar 7):** Dominant seventh (The notes C, E, G, and B-flat in the key of F# major spell out a C7 chord, which is the dominant 7th chord in the key of F major. Since the piece is in F# major, not F major, the B-flat is actually a B double flat. Thus, the chord is technically a C double flat dominant seventh chord. However, since the piece is in F# major, the chord can be interpreted as a C7 chord in F# major.)
- **Interval (Bar 8):** Minor Third (E to C is a minor third)
- **Rest (Bar 8):** Eighth rest (A dotted quarter note followed by a quarter note and an eighth rest make up a full bar of 6/8)
- **Period Type:** Parallel Period (Both phrases begin with an F# in the right hand and an F# octave below in the left hand.)
- **Allegretto vivace:** A tempo marking indicating a moderately fast tempo with a lively and brisk character.  "Allegretto" means moderately fast, while "vivace" adds the sense of liveliness.

**Summary:**

The piece is in F# Major and 6/8 time. It features a parallel period structure.  The harmony uses predominantly tonic, supertonic, and dominant chords, with some chromaticism (particularly the B-flat in bar 7). The "Allegretto vivace" marking suggests a bright and energetic mood.
