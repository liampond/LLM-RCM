**Key and Time Signature:**

1. **Key Signature Analysis:** The key signature has 3 sharps.  According to the table, this indicates either A major or F# minor.

2. **Major or Minor:**  The piece uses F#s frequently without explicitly marking them as accidentals, which suggests F# minor. The final chord also strongly suggests F# minor.

3. **Time Signature Inference:**
    * **Bar 1:** F# (quarter), C# (eighth), A (eighth), B (eighth), C# (eighth). Total duration: 1.5 beats (assuming an eighth note is 0.5 beats). This suggests a compound meter.
    * **Bar 2:** D (quarter), B (eighth), F# (eighth), E (eighth), D (eighth). Total duration: 1.5 beats. Again, this points to a compound meter.
    * **Bar 3:** C# (eighth), D# (eighth), E# (eighth), G# (eighth), F# (eighth), E# (eighth). Total duration: 1.5 beats.  Confirms compound meter.
    * **Bar 4:** F# (dotted half). Total duration: 1.5 beats.

Since each bar consistently adds up to 1.5 beats (where an eighth note equals 0.5), and the beaming suggests groupings of 3 eighth notes, the time signature is 6/8.

**Chord Analysis:**

* **Bar 1:** The prominent notes are F# (root), A (third), and C# (fifth), outlining an F# major chord. Therefore, the chord is **F#**.

* **Bar 2:** The most prominent notes are D (root), F# (third), and A (fifth), forming a D major chord.  Thus, the chord is **D**.

* **Bar 3:** The notes C#, D#, and E# suggest an implied C# major chord, enharmonically spelled as **Db**. The subsequent G#, F#, E# could be interpreted as part of a dominant seventh chord resolving to the tonic, but given the focus on triads, Db is the most likely chord symbol.

* **Bar 4:** The only note is F#, which is the tonic of the key.  Therefore, the chord is **F#**.

**Summary:**

* Key: F# minor
* Time Signature: 6/8
* Bar 1 Chord: F#
* Bar 2 Chord: D
* Bar 3 Chord: Db
* Bar 4 Chord: F#
