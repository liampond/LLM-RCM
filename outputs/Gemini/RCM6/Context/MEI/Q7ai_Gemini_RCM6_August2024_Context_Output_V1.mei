**Key Identification:**

1. **Key Signature:** The key signature has one sharp.

2. **Major or Minor:**  The piece uses G, B, F#, which suggests a G major chord. The piece also uses E and C, which, with the G, suggests a C major chord. The last measure uses D, B, and G, which suggests a G major chord. The other notes present, except for the F#, are also diatonic to G major.  The raised 7th degree in G major is F#. Since F# is present in the key signature, it does not help determine whether the key is major or minor. However, given the prominence of G major chords and the diatonic relationship of the other notes to G major, it is likely that the piece is in G major.

**Time Signature Identification:**

1. **Identify Beat Groupings:** The beaming groups the notes into sets of three sixteenths.

2. **Check Total Value of Beam Groupings:** Each grouping of three sixteenths totals 0.75 (3 * 0.25) or a dotted eighth note. This suggests a compound meter.

3. **Count Total Beats:** Measure 1 has four groups of three sixteenths, totaling 12 sixteenths. Measure 2 also has four groups of three sixteenths, totaling 12 sixteenths. Measure 3 has three groups of three sixteenths, plus a single eighth note and a single quarter note. This sums to 9 sixteenths + 2 sixteenths + 4 sixteenths = 15 sixteenths.  Since the first two measures have 12 sixteenths, and 12 is a multiple of 3, it is likely that the time signature is 12/16.

4. **Write Time Signature:** Given the analysis above, the time signature is likely 12/16.

**Summary:**

The key of the piece is G major. The time signature is 12/16.
