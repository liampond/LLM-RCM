**Key Identification:**

1. **Key Signature:** The key signature is 5 flats.

2. **Major or Minor:**  The key signature of 5 flats corresponds to D♭ Major or B♭ minor. The piece uses A♭s throughout, which is the raised 7th degree of B♭ minor (A♭ is enharmonically equivalent to G#). This strongly suggests B♭ minor.

3. **Other Clues:** The piece begins and ends on A♭ (enharmonically spelled as G#), the dominant of B♭ minor.  While not conclusive, this further supports the assessment of B♭ minor.

**Time Signature Identification:**

1. **Identify Beat Groupings:**
Measure 1: One eighth note (A♭). Value = 0.5
Measure 2: Two beamed eighth notes (D♭) + two beamed eighth notes (F). Value = 0.5 + 0.5 = 1
Measure 3: One quarter note (D♭) + two beamed eighth notes (A♭). Value = 1 + 0.5 = 1.5
Measure 4: Dotted eighth note tied to a sixteenth note (A♭) + sixteenth, sixteenth, sixteenth, sixteenth (E♭, D♭, C, B♭). Value = 0.75 + 0.25 = 1
Measure 5: One quarter note (A♭). Value = 1

2. **Check Total Value and Bottom Number:**
The rhythmic groupings suggest a mix of simple and compound time.  The presence of groupings adding up to 1 and 0.5 suggests a simple time signature with a quarter note beat (bottom number 4). The presence of a grouping adding up to 1.5 suggests a compound meter.  However, the most consistent beat value across the measures is the quarter note.

3. **Count Beats and Top Number:**
Converting everything to quarter notes:
Measure 1: 0.5 = half a beat.
Measure 2: 1 beat.
Measure 3: 1.5 beats.
Measure 4: 1 beat.
Measure 5: 1 beat.

The irregular beat counts across measures indicate the piece likely employs changing time signatures.  However, if a single time signature were to be chosen, 4/4 would be the most suitable due to the prevalence of quarter-note and half-note rhythmic values.  The irregular groupings could be interpreted as syncopation within a 4/4 framework.

**Summary:**

Key: B♭ minor
Time Signature:  While the rhythmic groupings suggest changing meters, if a single time signature were to be chosen, 4/4 would be the most suitable, with the irregular groupings interpreted as syncopation.
