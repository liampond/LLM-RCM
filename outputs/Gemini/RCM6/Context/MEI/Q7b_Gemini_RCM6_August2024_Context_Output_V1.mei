**Key:**

1. **Key Signature:** The key signature has 3 sharps.  According to the table, this indicates either A major or F# minor.

2. **Major or Minor:** In measure 1, there is a C sharp, which is present in the key signature. In measure 2, there is an F sharp, which is present in the key signature. In measure 3, there are two instances of E sharp and one instance of G sharp, which are present in the key signature. Therefore, there is no raised 7th degree present in the music. This strongly suggests the key is **A major**.

**Time Signature:**

1. **Identify Beat Groupings:**  The beaming in the music suggests groupings of:
    * Measure 1: (quarter, eighth) and (eighth, eighth, eighth)
    * Measure 2: (quarter, eighth) and (eighth, eighth, eighth)
    * Measure 3: (eighth, eighth, eighth) and (eighth, eighth, eighth)
    * Measure 4: (dotted half)

2. **Check Total Value:**
    * Each measure, except the last, adds up to a half note (2 quarter notes).
    * The final measure contains a dotted half note, totaling 3 quarter notes.  Since the double bar indicates the end, this suggests an incomplete measure.  The most likely time signature is one where each bar adds up to 2 quarter notes.

3. **Count Beats:**  Each full measure contains the equivalent of 2 quarter notes, or 4 eighth notes. This suggests a time signature with 4 as the top number.

4. **Time Signature:** Since the beat value is a quarter note (as shown by rhythmic groupings), the bottom number is 4.  Therefore, the time signature is **4/4**.

**Chord Symbols:**

* **Measure 1:** The notes F# (strong beat), A (weak beat), B (weak beat), and C# (strong beat) suggest an **F#m** chord (i in A major). The A and B function as passing tones.

* **Measure 2:** The notes D (strong beat), B (weak beat), F# (weak beat), E (weak beat), and D (weak beat) suggest a **D** chord (IV in A major). The B, F#, E, and D create a descending stepwise line.

* **Measure 3:** The notes C# (weak beat), D# (weak beat), E# (weak beat), G# (weak beat), F# (weak beat), and E# (weak beat) suggest an **E** chord (V in A major). The C#, D#, and first E# ascend stepwise, and the G#, F#, and second E# descend stepwise.

* **Measure 4:** The note F# (strong beat, held for 3 beats) suggests an **F#m** chord (i in A major).


**Summary:**

* Key: A major
* Time Signature: 4/4
* Measure 1: F#m
* Measure 2: D
* Measure 3: E
* Measure 4: F#m
