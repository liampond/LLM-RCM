**Measure 1:**

* Notes: A4 and G5
* Interval Number: Seventh (A-B-C-D-E-F-G)
* Quality:  A major scale: A, B, C#, D, E, F#, G#. G5 is one semitone lower than G#, thus a minor seventh.
* **Interval: Minor seventh**


**Measure 2:**

* Notes: F#4 and Bb4
* Interval Number: Fourth (F-G-A-B)
* Quality: F# major scale: F#, G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E#. Bb is two semitones lower than B natural, thus a diminished fourth.
* **Interval: Diminished fourth**


**Measure 3:**

* Notes: E4 and C#5
* Interval Number: Sixth (E-F-G-A-B-C)
* Quality: E major scale: E, F#, G#, A, B, C#, D#. C#5 matches the C# in the E major scale, thus a major sixth.
* **Interval: Major sixth**


**Measure 4:**

* Notes: Cb5 and D5
* Interval Number: Second (C-D)
* Quality: Cb major scale: Cb, Db, Eb, Fb, Gb, Ab, Bb. D5 is two semitones higher than Db, thus an augmented second.
* **Interval: Augmented second**


**Measure 5:**

* Notes: B4 and F#5
* Interval Number: Fifth (B-C-D-E-F)
* Quality: B major scale: B, C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A#. F#5 matches the F# in the B major scale, thus a perfect fifth.
* **Interval: Perfect fifth**
