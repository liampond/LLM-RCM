**Key and Time Signature Identification**

1. **Key Signature:** The key signature is 3 sharps.  According to the table, this indicates either A major or F# minor.

2. **Major or Minor:** In measure 1, there is an F# (which is in the key signature) and a C#. Since C# is the raised 7th degree of F# minor, the key is likely F# minor.  There are no accidentals present that suggest A Major.

3. **Time Signature:**
    * **Measure 1:** F# (quarter), C# (eighth), A (eighth), B (eighth), C# (eighth) = a total of 1.5 beats (using the quarter note as 1 beat).
    * **Measure 2:** D (quarter), B (eighth), F# (eighth), E (eighth), D (eighth) = a total of 1.5 beats.
    * **Measure 3:** C# (eighth), D# (eighth), E# (eighth), G# (eighth), F# (eighth), E# (eighth) = a total of 1.5 beats.
    * **Measure 4:** F# (dotted half) = a total of 3 beats.

Since the first three measures add up to 1.5 beats each, and the last measure doubles that duration, the most likely time signature is 3/4.  Each measure contains the equivalent of three quarter notes.  The beaming of the eighth notes in groups of three also supports a compound meter.

**Chord Symbol Identification**

1. **Measure 1:** The most prominent notes are F# (downbeat) and C# (relatively long duration).  The A and B serve as passing tones. This suggests an F# minor chord: **F#m**.

2. **Measure 2:** The most prominent notes are D (downbeat) and B. The F#, E, and D form a descending stepwise line. This suggests a D major chord: **D**.

3. **Measure 3:** The ascending chromatic line C#-D#-E# strongly suggests an A major chord: **A**. The G# and F# are likely a neighboring motion/incomplete neighbor.

4. **Measure 4:** The only note present is F#, which is the tonic of the key. This suggests an F# minor chord: **F#m**.

**Summary**

* Key: F# minor
* Time Signature: 3/4
* Measure 1 Chord: F#m
* Measure 2 Chord: D
* Measure 3 Chord: A
* Measure 4 Chord: F#m
