**Measure 1:**

1. **Beat Groupings:**  We can identify the following rhythmic groups:
    * Dotted quarter note + eighth note (12 ppq + 4 ppq = 16 ppq)
    * Eighth note (4 ppq)
    * Two sixteenths + eighth (2 ppq + 2 ppq + 4 ppq = 8 ppq)
    * Two eighth notes (4 ppq + 4 ppq = 8 ppq)

2. **Total Value and Beat:** The groupings suggest simple time.  A quarter note (8 ppq) or dotted quarter note (12 ppq) could be the beat, but the consistent beaming of two eighth notes (8 ppq) suggests a quarter note beat.

3. **Total Beats:**  If a quarter note gets the beat, the measure contains 4 beats (16 ppq + 8ppq + 8ppq = 32 ppq = 4 quarter notes).

4. **Time Signature:** 4/4

**Measure 2:**

1. **Beat Groupings:**
    * Four sixteenths (2+2+1+1 ppq = 6 ppq)
    * Dotted eighth + sixteenth + sixteenth (3+1+2 ppq = 6 ppq)
    * Eighth + sixteenth (4+2 ppq = 6 ppq)

2. **Total Value and Beat:** The beaming and values suggest compound time. Each group adds up to a dotted quarter note (6 ppq).  Since compound meter divides the beat into three, the eighth note (2 ppq) gets the beat.

3. **Total Beats:** The measure contains 9 eighth notes (6 ppq + 6 ppq + 6 ppq = 18 ppq = 9 eighth notes).

4. **Time Signature:** 9/8
