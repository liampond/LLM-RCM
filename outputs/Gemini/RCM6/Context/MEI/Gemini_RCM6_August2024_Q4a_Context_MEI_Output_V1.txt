The original key is E major. The melody is:

E4 (half note), G#4 (quarter note), B4 (quarter note), D#4 (dotted quarter note), E4 (16th note), F#4 (16th note), E4 (quarter note), C#5 (half note), B4 (quarter note), E5 (quarter note), B4 (quarter note), A4 (eighth note), G#4 (16th note), A4 (16th note), G#4 (quarter note).


Transposed up a minor sixth (add 9 semitones), the melody becomes:

C#5 (half note), E#5 (quarter note), G#5 (quarter note), B#5 (dotted quarter note), C#6 (16th note), D#6 (16th note), C#6 (quarter note), A#5 (half note), G#5 (quarter note), C#6 (quarter note), G#5 (quarter note), F#5 (eighth note), E#5 (16th note), F#5 (16th note), E#5 (quarter note).

The new key is B major (5 sharps).  Since the new key is B major, all instances of C#, D#, F#, G# and A# should not have accidentals.  E# is enharmonic with F natural, and B# is enharmonic with C natural.  Therefore, the transposed melody should be written as:

C#5 (half note), F5 (quarter note), G#5 (quarter note), C6 (dotted quarter note), C#6 (16th note), D#6 (16th note), C#6 (quarter note), A#5 (half note), G#5 (quarter note), C#6 (quarter note), G#5 (quarter note), F#5 (eighth note), F5 (16th note), F#5 (16th note), F5 (quarter note).
