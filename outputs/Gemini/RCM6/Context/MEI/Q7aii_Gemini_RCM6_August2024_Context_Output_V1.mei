**Key Identification:**

1. **Check the Key Signature:** The key signature has 5 flats.  According to the table, this corresponds to D♭ Major or B♭ minor.

2. **Determine Major or Minor:** The piece uses A♭s consistently without accidentals, which is the natural 7th degree of B♭ minor.  There are no A♮s present, which would indicate the raised 7th of the B♭ minor scale. This strongly suggests B♭ minor.

3. **Other Clues:** The piece begins and ends on A♭, the tonic of B♭ minor.  The melodic contour and implied harmonies also support B♭ minor.

**Time Signature Identification:**

1. **Identify Beat Groupings:**
    * Measure 1: One eighth note (A♭).
    * Measure 2: Two pairs of beamed eighth notes.
    * Measure 3: A quarter note followed by two beamed eighth notes.
    * Measure 4: A dotted eighth note followed by a sixteenth note, then a sixteenth followed by a sixteenth, sixteenth, and sixteenth note grouping.
    * Measure 5: One quarter note (A♭).

2. **Check Total Value and Bottom Number:**
    * Measure 1: 0.5 beats (eighth note). Suggests simple time with a bottom number of 8.
    * Measure 2: Two groups of 0.5 beats each (eighth notes).  Reinforces simple time with a bottom number of 8.
    * Measure 3: 1 beat (quarter) + 0.5 beats (two eighths) = 1.5 beats.  Still consistent with simple time, where the quarter note gets the beat (bottom number 4).
    * Measure 4: Dotted eighth (0.75) + sixteenth (0.25) = 1 beat, followed by four sixteenths (1 beat). Consistent with simple time, bottom number 4.
    * Measure 5: 1 beat (quarter note). Consistent with simple time, bottom number 4.

3. **Count Total Beats:**
    * Measure 1: 1 beat (one eighth = half a beat in 4/4, but the measure is incomplete, suggesting pick-up).
    * Measure 2: 2 beats (two groups of beamed eighth notes).
    * Measure 3: 2 beats (quarter note + two beamed eighth notes).
    * Measure 4: 2 beats (dotted eighth + sixteenth, then four sixteenths).
    * Measure 5: 1 beat (quarter note).

4. **Write Time Signature:**  The consistent beat groupings of 2 beats per measure, with subdivisions based on quarters, eighths, and sixteenths, strongly suggests a time signature of 2/4.

**Summary:**

The key of the piece is B♭ minor. The time signature is 2/4.
