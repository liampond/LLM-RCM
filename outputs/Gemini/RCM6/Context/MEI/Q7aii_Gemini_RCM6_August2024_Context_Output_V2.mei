**Key Analysis:**

1. **Key Signature:** The key signature contains 5 flats.  According to the table, this corresponds to D♭ Major or B♭ minor.

2. **Major or Minor:**  The piece uses A♭s throughout, which is the raised 7th degree of B♭ minor. This strongly suggests the key is B♭ minor.

3. **Other Clues:** The piece begins and ends on A♭, the tonic of B♭ minor.

**Time Signature Analysis:**

1. **Identify Beat Groupings:**
Measure 1: One eighth note (A♭). It does not define the time signature.
Measure 2: Two groups of beamed eighth notes.
Measure 3: One quarter note followed by two beamed eighth notes.
Measure 4: Dotted eighth followed by a sixteenth. Then, a sixteenth followed by three sixteenths.
Measure 5: One quarter note (A♭).

2. **Check Total Value and Bottom Number:**
Measure 2 implies simple time, with the eighth note as the beat unit (bottom number 8).
Measure 3 reinforces simple time, with the eighth note as the beat unit.
Measure 4 contains a mix of eighth, sixteenth, and dotted eighth notes.  However, the dotted eighth + sixteenth combination adds up to a quarter note, suggesting a beat unit of a quarter note (bottom number 4).

3. **Count Total Beats:**
Measure 1: 0.5 beats (if the beat unit is an eighth note).
Measure 2: 2 beats.
Measure 3: 2 beats.
Measure 4: 2 beats.
Measure 5: 1 beat.

4. **Determine Time Signature:**
The most consistent beat unit throughout the piece appears to be the eighth note.  If we consider the first measure as an incomplete measure (anacrusis), the subsequent measures all contain 2 beats. This suggests a time signature of 2/8.

**Summary:**

Key: B♭ minor
Time Signature: 2/8
