**Key Analysis:**

1. **Key Signature:** The key signature has one sharp.  According to the table, this corresponds to G major or E minor.

2. **Major or Minor:** In measure 2, there is a D-sharp. If the piece were in G major, the D-sharp would not be necessary. The D-sharp suggests a raised 7th degree in E minor.  Other notes and implied harmonies throughout the piece also point towards E minor.

3. **Other Clues:** While brief, the melodic and harmonic implications lean towards E minor.

**Time Signature Analysis:**

1. **Identify Beat Groupings:**
   - Measure 1: (sixteenth rest), (four sixteenths beamed together), (sixteenth)
   - Measure 2: (six sixteenths beamed together)
   - Measure 3: (32nd, 32nd, sixteenth), (eighth), (eighth rest)
   - Measure 4: (32nd, 32nd, sixteenth), (eighth), (eighth rest)

2. **Check Total Value and Bottom Number:**
   - Consistent groupings of 2 sixteenths, or 1 eighth note, suggest a simple time signature with an eighth note receiving the beat (bottom number 8).

3. **Count Beats:**
   - Measure 1 contains 4 eighth notes worth of notes + a sixteenth rest = 4.5 eighth notes.
   - Measure 2 contains 6 eighth notes worth of notes = 6 eighth notes.
   - Measure 3 contains 2 eighth notes + an eighth rest = 3 eighth notes.
   - Measure 4 contains 2 eighth notes + an eighth rest = 3 eighth notes.

4. **Determine Time Signature:** The irregular number of beats per measure (4.5, 6, 3, 3) suggests an additive time signature.  The most logical representation of this would be 4.5/8 + 6/8 + 3/8 + 3/8.  This can be simplified to 2/8 + 3/8 + 3/8 + 3/8 + 3/8.

**Summary:**

The key of the piece is E minor. The time signature is additive, best represented as a combination of 2/8, 3/8, and 4.5/8 measures.
