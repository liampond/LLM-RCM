**Key Identification:**

1. **Key Signature:** The key signature has one sharp.

2. **Major or Minor:**  The piece uses accidentals outside the key signature. In measure 2, D-sharp and F-sharp appear. F-sharp is consistent with G major, but D-sharp suggests a raised 6th degree, which is characteristic of the harmonic minor or melodic minor scales.  The final note, A, also points towards A minor (the relative minor of G major). Therefore, the key is likely A minor (harmonic or melodic).

**Time Signature Identification:**

1. **Identify Beat Groupings:**
    * Measure 1:  Sixteenth rest followed by five sixteenth notes beamed together.
    * Measure 2: Six sixteenth notes beamed together.
    * Measure 3: Four sixteenth notes beamed together (32nd + 32nd + 16th + 8th = a quarter + an eighth + an eighth = 2 quarters). Followed by a quarter note rest.
    * Measure 4: Four sixteenth notes beamed together (32nd + 32nd + 16th + 8th = a quarter + an eighth + an eighth = 2 quarters). Followed by a quarter note rest.

2. **Check Total Value and Bottom Number:**
    * Each measure adds up to the equivalent of 4 eighth notes or two quarter notes. Since the beaming suggests groupings of 2 sixteenths or 4 sixteenths, we are dealing with simple time.  The most straightforward bottom number would be 4, representing a quarter note beat.

3. **Count Beats and Top Number:**
    * Measure one has two quarter notes worth of notes.
    * Measure two has two quarter notes worth of notes.
    * Measure three has two quarter notes worth of notes.
    * Measure four has two quarter notes worth of notes.
    * Therefore, the top number is 2.

4. **Write Time Signature:** 2/4

**Summary:**

The key of the piece is A natural minor (although the use of D# suggests the harmonic or melodic minor). The time signature is 2/4.
