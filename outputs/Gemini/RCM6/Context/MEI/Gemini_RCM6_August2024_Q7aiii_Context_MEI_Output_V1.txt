**Key Identification:**

1. **Key Signature:** The key signature has one sharp.  According to the table, this corresponds to G major or E minor.

2. **Major or Minor:** In measure 2, there's an F-sharp, which is already in the key signature.  Critically, there's also a D-sharp which is not in the key signature. D# is the raised 7th degree of E minor. This strongly suggests the key is E minor.

**Time Signature Identification:**

1. **Identify Beat Groupings:**  The beaming in the MEI file shows the following rhythmic groupings:

* Measure 1: (sixteenth rest), (sixteenth, sixteenth, sixteenth, sixteenth, sixteenth)
* Measure 2: (sixteenth, sixteenth, sixteenth, sixteenth, sixteenth, sixteenth)
* Measure 3: (thirty-second, thirty-second, sixteenth, eighth), (eighth rest)
* Measure 4: (thirty-second, thirty-second, sixteenth, eighth), (eighth rest)

2. **Check Total Value and Bottom Number:**

* Let's consider the smallest division, the thirty-second note (1/32).
* Measure 1 contains the equivalent of 8 thirty-second notes + a sixteenth rest (equivalent to two thirty-seconds) for a total of 10/32.
* Measure 2 contains the equivalent of 8 thirty-second notes for a total of 8/32.
* Measures 3 and 4 each contain 8 thirty-second notes for a total of 8/32.

Notice that the thirty-second notes are beamed to form eighth notes.  This suggests that the eighth note gets the beat.  Therefore, the bottom number of the time signature is 8.

3. **Count Total Beats:**

* Measure 1 has 5 sixteenth notes, equivalent to 10 thirty-second notes or five eighth notes.  With the sixteenth rest (1/16 or 2/32), the total rhythmic value is 5/8 + 1/16 = 11/16.
* Measure 2 has 6 sixteenth notes, equivalent to 1 beat.
* Measures 3 and 4 each have 1 beat.

The irregular rhythmic values across measures indicate an additive time signature.  The total rhythmic values are:

* Measure 1: 5/8 + 1/16 = 11/16
* Measure 2: 1
* Measure 3: 1
* Measure 4: 1

The time signature must accommodate the largest measure, which is measure 1 with a rhythmic value of 11/16.  This can be represented as 11/8.  The other measures can be interpreted as incomplete measures within this framework.

**Summary:**

The key of the piece is E minor. The time signature, inferred from the rhythmic structure, is best represented as 11/8 to accommodate the first measure, with subsequent measures treated as incomplete within this framework.
