**Key Identification:**

1. **Check the Key Signature:** The key signature has one sharp, which corresponds to G major or E minor.

2. **Determine Major or Minor:**  The piece uses F sharps (in measure 1), which is the leading tone in E minor. This strongly suggests E minor.

3. **Other Clues:** The piece emphasizes the G major chord (dominant of E minor) and ends on an E minor chord.

**Time Signature Identification:**

1. **Identify Beat Groupings:** Measure 1 has four beam groupings, each consisting of three 16th notes. Measure 2 has four beam groupings. The first consists of three 16th notes. The second consists of an 8th note and a 16th note (equal to three 16th notes). The third consists of three 16th notes. The fourth consists of an 8th note (equal to two 16th notes).

2. **Check Total Value of Beam Groupings:** Each grouping in measure 1 has a total rhythmic value of 3/16, indicating compound time. The smallest beat value is a 16th note, making the bottom number of the time signature 16. In measure 2, the first three groupings have a total rhythmic value of 3/16. The last grouping has a total rhythmic value of 2/16.

3. **Count Total Beats:** Measure 1 has four groupings of three 16th notes, totaling twelve 16th notes. Measure 2 has three groupings of three 16th notes and one grouping of two 16th notes, totaling eleven 16th notes. The time signature must accommodate the longer measure.

4. **Write Time Signature:** The most common compound meter with 12 subdivisions would be 12/16. However, given the irregular grouping in measure 2, it is more accurate to represent the time signature as 12/16 for measure 1 and 11/16 for measure 2.

**Summary:**

The key is E minor. The time signature is 12/16 for the first full measure and 11/16 for the second measure. The piece ends on a half cadence in E minor.
