- Key: F# major (1 flat in the key signature, no accidentals suggesting a minor key)
- Time Signature: 6/8 (Each beamed group of eighth notes adds up to a dotted quarter note (1.5 beats).  There are two beamed groups per measure, totaling 3 beats. Each beat is made up of two eighth notes, so one small beat is an eighth note. Thus, the time signature is 6/8.)
- Chord in Bar 2: Supertonic triad (The notes F, B♭, and D form a D major chord, which is the supertonic chord in F# major.)
- Interval: Diminished fifth (C to G♭)
- Functional Chord Symbol in Bar 5: I (Tonic chord in F# major: F#, A, C#)
- Chord in Bar 7: Subdominant triad (C, F, A; an A minor chord, which is the subdominant in F# major)
- Interval: Major second (E to F#)
- Rest in Bar 8: Eighth rest (A dotted quarter note followed by a quarter note and an eighth rest completes the 6/8 measure.)
- Period Type: Parallel period (Both phrases begin with similar melodic material: F# in the right hand and F in the left hand.)
- Allegretto vivace:  A tempo marking indicating a moderately fast tempo with a lively and brisk character. "Allegretto" means moderately fast, and "vivace" adds the sense of liveliness.
