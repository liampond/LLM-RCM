**Key Identification:**

1. **Key Signature:** The key signature has one sharp.  According to the table, this corresponds to G major or E minor.

2. **Major or Minor:**  The piece uses F sharps (F#). Since F# is present throughout and is not an accidental (it's part of the key signature), this strongly suggests G major.  There are no instances of an accidental that would suggest a raised 7th degree in E minor (D#).

3. **Other Clues:** The piece begins and ends on G, the tonic of G major. The melodic and harmonic content also aligns with G major.

**Time Signature Identification:**

1. **Identify Beat Groupings:** In the first full measure, there are four beam groupings. Each grouping contains three sixteenth notes.

2. **Check Total Value of Beam Groupings:** Each beam grouping totals 0.75 (3 * 0.25). This suggests a compound meter. Since the smallest division is a sixteenth note, the bottom number of the time signature will be 16.

3. **Count Total Beats:** There are four beam groupings, each representing three sixteenth notes. Therefore, there are 12 sixteenth notes in the measure (4 groupings * 3 sixteenths/grouping = 12 sixteenths).  Since this is compound time, the top number will reflect the number of main beats, not the subdivisions. Each group of three sixteenths forms one beat, so there are four beats per measure.

4. **Write Time Signature:** The time signature is 12/16, which simplifies to 3/4.  While the beaming suggests 12/16, the underlying pulse is clearly that of 3/4.

**Summary:**

The key of the piece is G major. The time signature is 3/4.
