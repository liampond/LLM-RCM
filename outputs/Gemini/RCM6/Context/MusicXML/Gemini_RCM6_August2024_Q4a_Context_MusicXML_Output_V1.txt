The original key is E major. The melody is:

E4 (half note) | G#4 (quarter note) B4 (quarter note) | D#4 (dotted quarter note) E4 (16th note) F#4 (16th note) E4 (quarter note) | rest (quarter note) | C#5 (half note) B4 (quarter note) E5 (quarter note) | B4 (quarter note) A4 (eighth note) G#4 (16th note) A4 (16th note) G#4 (quarter note) | rest (quarter note)


Transposed up a minor sixth (add 9 semitones), the melody becomes:

C#5 (half note) | E#5 (quarter note) G#5 (quarter note) | A#4 (dotted quarter note) C#5 (16th note) D#5 (16th note) C#5 (quarter note) | rest (quarter note) | A#5 (half note) G#5 (quarter note) C#6 (quarter note) | G#5 (quarter note) F#5 (eighth note) E#5 (16th note) F#5 (16th note) E#5 (quarter note) | rest (quarter note)

The new key is C# major (or Db major).  The key signature will have seven sharps.
