**Key Analysis:**

1. **Key Signature:** The key signature has one sharp.  According to the table, this corresponds to G major or E minor.

2. **Major or Minor:**  The piece uses D# in measure 4. In the G major scale, the seventh degree is F#. Raising it by a half step results in F# to G, not D#. However, in E minor, the seventh degree is D. Raising it by a half step results in D# (D to D#). Therefore, the key is E minor.

3. **Other Clues:** The piece ends on an E minor chord (E, G, B in measure 3), further supporting the conclusion that the key is E minor.


**Time Signature Analysis:**

**Measure 1:**

* Group 1: 16th rest, followed by five 16th notes. Total value: 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2 note = 4/8.

**Measure 2:**

* Group 1: Six 16th notes. Total value: 6/16 = 3/8.

**Measure 3:**

* Group 1: 32nd, 32nd, 16th. Total value: 1/16 = 1/8.
* Group 2: Eighth note. Total value = 2/8.
* Group 3: Eighth rest. Total value = 2/8.

**Measure 4:**

* Group 1: 32nd, 32nd, 16th. Total value: 1/8.
* Group 2: Eighth note. Total value = 2/8.
* Group 3: Eighth rest. Total value = 2/8.

Notice that all measures can be expressed as combinations of eighth notes.  The total rhythmic values of the measures are:

* Measure 1: 4 eighth notes.
* Measure 2: 3 eighth notes.
* Measure 3: 4 eighth notes.
* Measure 4: 4 eighth notes.

This suggests an irregular time signature. The most appropriate time signature to accommodate these varying rhythmic values is 7/8, 5/8, 7/8, and 7/8 for measures 1 through 4 respectively.

**Summary:**

The key of the piece is E minor. The time signature is irregular, with measures 1 through 4 being 7/8, 5/8, 7/8, and 7/8 respectively.
