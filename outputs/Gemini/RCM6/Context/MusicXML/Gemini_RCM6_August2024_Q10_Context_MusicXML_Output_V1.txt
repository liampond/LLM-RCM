- **Key:** F major (one flat key signature, no raised 7th degree in the melody)
- **Time Signature:** 6/8 (Each measure consists of six eighth notes. The beaming groups them into two groups of three eighth notes, indicating compound duple meter.)
- **Chord in Bar 2:** Supertonic triad (The notes D, F, and B♭ form a D minor triad, which is the supertonic chord in F major.)
- **Interval Bar 2-3:** Minor third (C to E♭)
- **Functional Chord Symbol Bar 5:** I (Tonic chord in F major, spelled F-A-C)
- **Chord in Bar 7:** Dominant seventh chord (The notes C, E, G, and B♭ form a C7 chord, which is the dominant seventh chord in F major.)
- **Interval Bar 8:** Augmented fourth (E to B♭ is an augmented fourth. It is enharmonically equivalent to a diminished fifth, but the notation presents it as an augmented fourth.)
- **Rest in Bar 8:** Eighth rest (A quarter note and an eighth rest complete the 6/8 measure.)
- **Period Type:** Parallel period (Both phrases begin with nearly identical melodic material (F6 followed by C6).  The slight rhythmic variation in the second phrase doesn't negate the parallel structure.)
- **Allegretto vivace:** A tempo marking indicating a moderately fast tempo with a lively and brisk character.  "Allegretto" means moderately fast, and "vivace" adds the sense of liveliness.

**Summary:**

The piece is in F major, 6/8 time, and features a parallel period structure.  It uses primarily tonic, supertonic, and dominant harmony, with some chromaticism (augmented fourth). The tempo is allegretto vivace, suggesting a bright and energetic mood.
