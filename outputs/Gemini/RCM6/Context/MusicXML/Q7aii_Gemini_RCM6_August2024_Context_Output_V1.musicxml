**Key Analysis:**

1. **Key Signature:** The key signature contains 5 flats.  According to the table, this corresponds to D♭ Major or B♭ Minor.

2. **Major or Minor:**  The piece uses A♭ frequently, and prominently features an A♭ in the final measure. There are no accidentals present that suggest a raised 7th degree in B♭ minor (which would be an A♮). This points towards D♭ Major.

3. **Other Clues:** The piece begins and ends on A♭, which is the subdominant of D♭ Major. The melodic contour and harmonies (implied) do not strongly suggest a minor tonality.

**Time Signature Analysis:**

1. **Identify Beat Groupings:**
   - Measure 1: (eighth, eighth); (eighth, eighth)
   - Measure 2: (quarter); (eighth, eighth)
   - Measure 3: (dotted eighth, sixteenth); (sixteenth, sixteenth, sixteenth, sixteenth)
   - Measure 4: (quarter)

2. **Check Total Value and Bottom Number:**
   - Each grouping in measures 1 and 2 adds up to a quarter note (1 beat). This suggests simple time with a bottom number of 4.
   - Measure 3 contains groupings that add up to a quarter note each. This reinforces simple time with a bottom number of 4.
   - Measure 4 also supports this.

3. **Count Total Beats:**
   - Measure 1: 4 eighth notes = 2 beats
   - Measure 2: 1 quarter note + 2 eighth notes = 2 beats
   - Measure 3: 1 dotted eighth + 1 sixteenth + 4 sixteenths = 2 beats
   - Measure 4: 1 quarter note = 1 beat (due to the final double barline)

4. **Write Time Signature:**  The consistent grouping of notes into quarter-note beats suggests a simple time signature. Measures 1-3 consistently have 2 beats. Therefore, the time signature is 2/4.

**Summary:**

The key of the piece is D♭ Major. The time signature is 2/4.
