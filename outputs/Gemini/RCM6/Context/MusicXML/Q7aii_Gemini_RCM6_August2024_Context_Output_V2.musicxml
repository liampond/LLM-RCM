1. **Key Signature:** The key signature contains 5 flats.  According to the table, this corresponds to D♭ Major or B♭ Minor.

2. **Major or Minor:**  The piece uses A♭ frequently, and ends on an A♭. The seventh degree of B♭ minor is A, which would be raised to A♮ in the minor key. There are no A♮s present in the music. Therefore, the key is likely D♭ Major.

**Time Signature Analysis:**

1. **Identify Beat Groupings:**
Measure 1: (eighth, eighth), (eighth, eighth)
Measure 2: (quarter), (eighth, eighth)
Measure 3: (dotted eighth, sixteenth), (sixteenth, sixteenth, sixteenth, sixteenth)
Measure 4: (quarter)

2. **Check Total Value and Bottom Number:**
Each grouping in measure 1 adds up to 0.5 + 0.5 = 1 (quarter note). This suggests simple time with a bottom number of 4.
Measure 2 reinforces this: 1 + (0.5 + 0.5) = 2.
Measure 3: (0.75 + 0.25) + (0.25 * 4) = 1 + 1 = 2.
Measure 4: 1.

3. **Count Total Beats:**
Measure 1: Two groupings of 1 beat each = 2 beats.
Measure 2: 1 + 1 = 2 beats.
Measure 3: 2 beats.
Measure 4: 1 beat (due to the final double barline).

4. **Write Time Signature:**  All complete measures have 2 beats, with a quarter note representing one beat. Therefore, the time signature is 2/4.

**Summary:**

The key of the piece is D♭ Major, and the time signature is 2/4.
