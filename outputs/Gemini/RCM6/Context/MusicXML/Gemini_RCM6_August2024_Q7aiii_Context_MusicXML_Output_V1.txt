**Key Analysis:**

1. **Key Signature:** The key signature has one sharp.  According to the table, this corresponds to G major or E minor.

2. **Major or Minor:**  In measure 2, there is a D♯. If the key were G major, D♯ would be the raised 7th degree (leading tone), suggesting a modulation or a secondary dominant chord. However, the piece is short and doesn't develop enough to suggest a proper modulation. The consistent use of G♮ throughout the piece, and the absence of other accidentals that would clearly point to E minor, makes G major the more likely key.

3. **Other Clues:** The piece begins and ends with implied G major tonality.  While the fragment is short, the melodic and harmonic implications lean towards G major.

**Time Signature Analysis:**

1. **Identify Beat Groupings:**
    * Measure 1: (16th rest), (16th, 16th, 16th, 16th, 16th) - The beamed 16th notes suggest groupings of irregular numbers of notes.
    * Measure 2: (16th, 16th, 16th, 16th, 16th, 16th) - Beamed 16th notes again.
    * Measure 3: (32nd, 32nd, 16th), (eighth), (eighth rest) -  The first group sums to an eighth note. The following eighth note and eighth rest confirm eighth note groupings.
    * Measure 4: (32nd, 32nd, 16th), (eighth), (eighth rest) - Similar to measure 3, suggesting eighth note groupings.

2. **Check Total Value and Beat Value:**
    * The consistent presence of eighth notes and eighth rests, along with groups of shorter notes that sum to eighth notes, strongly suggests a simple time signature with the eighth note as the beat unit (bottom number 8).

3. **Count Total Beats:**
    * Measure 1 contains 5 sixteenth notes plus a sixteenth rest, totaling 6 sixteenth notes or 3 eighth notes.
    * Measure 2 contains 6 sixteenth notes, totaling 3 eighth notes.
    * Measures 3 and 4 each contain 2 eighth notes and an eighth rest, totaling 3 eighth notes.

4. **Write Time Signature:**  Each measure consistently contains the equivalent of 3 eighth notes. Therefore, the time signature is 3/8.

**Summary:**

The key of the piece is G major. The time signature is 3/8.
