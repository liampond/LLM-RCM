1. **Check the Key Signature:** The key signature has 5 flats.

2. **Major/Minor:**  The key signature of 5 flats corresponds to D♭ Major or B♭ minor.  There are no accidentals present in the music that raise the 7th degree of the B♭ minor scale (A♭). Therefore, the key is D♭ Major.

**Time Signature Analysis:**

1. **Identify the Beat Groupings:**
   - Measure 1: (eighth, eighth), (eighth, eighth)
   - Measure 2: (quarter), (eighth, eighth)
   - Measure 3: (dotted eighth, sixteenth), (sixteenth, sixteenth, sixteenth, sixteenth)

2. **Check the Total Value of the Beam Groupings:**
   - In measure 1, each group of two eighth notes equals one quarter note (0.5 + 0.5 = 1). This suggests simple time with a quarter note beat.
   - In measure 2, the quarter note sustains for one beat, and the two eighth notes equal one quarter note.
   - In measure 3, the dotted eighth and sixteenth equal one quarter note (0.75 + 0.25 = 1), and the four sixteenth notes equal one quarter note (0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 = 1).

3. **Count the Total Beats in the Measure:**
   - Each measure contains notes equivalent to two quarter notes, totaling 2 beats per measure.

4. **Write the Time Signature:** Since each beat is a quarter note (1) and there are two beats per measure, the time signature is 2/4.

**Summary:**

The key of the piece is D♭ Major, and the time signature is 2/4.
