**Key and Time Signature:**

1. **Key Signature Analysis:** The key signature has 3 sharps.  According to the table, this indicates either A major or F# minor.

2. **Major or Minor:** Measure 3 has E# and G#, suggesting the raised 7th degree characteristic of the F# minor scale. Therefore, the key is F# minor.

3. **Time Signature Analysis:** Each measure contains 6 eighth notes (or their equivalent). This suggests a time signature of 6/8.

**Chord Analysis:**

* **Measure 1:** The prominent notes are F#5, C#5, and A4. These spell out an F# minor chord. Therefore, the chord is **F#m**.

* **Measure 2:** The prominent notes are D5, B4, and F#5.  These notes form a B minor chord in first inversion. Therefore, the chord is **Bm**.

* **Measure 3:** The most prominent notes are C#5, G#5, and E#5 (the latter two on strong beats). These spell out a C# major chord in second inversion. Therefore, the chord is **C#**.

* **Measure 4:** The only note is F#5, sustained for the entire measure. This clearly implies an F# minor chord. Therefore, the chord is **F#m**.

**Summary:**

* Key: F# minor
* Time Signature: 6/8
* Measure 1: F#m
* Measure 2: Bm
* Measure 3: C#
* Measure 4: F#m
