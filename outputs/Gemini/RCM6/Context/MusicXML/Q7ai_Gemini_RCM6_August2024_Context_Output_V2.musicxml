**Key Analysis:**

1. **Key Signature:** The key signature has one sharp, which corresponds to G major or E minor.

2. **Major or Minor:**  The piece prominently features the notes of the G major scale (G, A, B, C, D, E, F#). There is no raised seventh degree of the E minor scale (D#) present. This strongly suggests G major.

3. **Other Clues:** The piece begins and ends on G, the tonic of G major. The melodic and harmonic content does not emphasize minor triads or characteristic minor progressions.

**Time Signature Analysis:**

1. **Identify Beat Groupings:** The piece consistently groups notes in sets of four sixteenths.  For example, in measure 1, we see (16th, 16th, 16th, 16th) groupings.

2. **Check Total Value:** Each grouping of four sixteenths equals one quarter note (1.0). This indicates simple time. Since one beat equals a quarter note, the bottom number of the time signature will be 4.

3. **Count Total Beats:**
    * Measure 1 contains four groups of four sixteenths, totaling 4 beats.
    * Measure 2 contains three groups of four sixteenths and one eighth note + one eighth note (equivalent to a fourth group of four sixteenths), totaling 4 beats.

4. **Write Time Signature:** The time signature is 4/4.

**Summary:**

The key of the piece is G major. The time signature is 4/4.
