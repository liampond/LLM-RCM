**Key and Time Signature Identification**

1. **Key Signature:** The key signature has 3 sharps, suggesting either A major or F# minor.

2. **Major or Minor:**  Measure 3 features an E# not present in the key signature. E# is the leading tone of F# minor. Therefore, the key is **F# minor**.

3. **Time Signature:**
    * Each measure contains 6 eighth notes (or the equivalent).
    * The notes are grouped in ways that suggest a simple time signature (e.g., groupings of 2 and 4 eighth notes).  Specifically, the first bar contains a quarter note followed by two eighth notes followed by three eighth notes.  The second bar contains a quarter note followed by an eighth note followed by three eighth notes. The third bar contains three eighth notes followed by three eighth notes. The fourth bar contains a dotted half note.
    * Given that a quarter note equals two eighth notes, we can see that each bar contains the equivalent of three quarter notes.
    * Therefore, the time signature is **3/4**.

**Chord Symbol Analysis**

* **Bar 1:** The prominent notes are F#5 (downbeat), C#5, and A4. This suggests an **F#m** chord.

* **Bar 2:** The prominent notes are D5 (downbeat), B4, and F#5. This outlines a **B** chord (specifically, a B major chord as the F# is natural).

* **Bar 3:** The most prominent notes are C#5, E#5, and G#5. This suggests a **C#** chord (specifically C# major because of the E#).

* **Bar 4:** The only note is F#5, implying an **F#m** chord.
