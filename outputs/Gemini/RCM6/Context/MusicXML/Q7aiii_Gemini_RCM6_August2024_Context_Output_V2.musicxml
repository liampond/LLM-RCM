**Key Analysis:**

1. **Key Signature:** The key signature has one sharp.  According to the table, this corresponds to G major or E minor.

2. **Major or Minor:**  In measure 2, there is a D♯. In the key of G major, the seventh degree is F♯. The D♯ does not indicate a raised seventh degree of G major. In the key of E minor, the seventh degree is D. Therefore, the D♯ indicates a raised seventh degree, which strongly suggests the piece is in E minor. Measure 4 also has a C♯ and D♯, which further supports E minor.

3. **Other Clues:** The piece ends on an E minor chord (E, G, B in measure 4), confirming E minor.

**Time Signature Analysis:**

**Measure 1:**

* Grouping 1: 16th rest (0.5 beats) + four 16th notes (0.5 beats) = 1 beat.

**Measure 2:**

* Grouping 1: Six 16th notes (0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 beats) = 1.5 beats.

**Measure 3:**

* Grouping 1: 32nd, 32nd, 16th (0.25 + 0.25 + 0.5 beats) = 1 beat.
* Grouping 2: Eighth note (1 beat) = 1 beat.

**Measure 4:**

* Grouping 1: 32nd, 32nd, 16th (0.25 + 0.25 + 0.5 beats) = 1 beat.
* Grouping 2: Eighth note (1 beat) = 1 beat.

Considering the consistent presence of groupings adding up to 1 beat or values easily divisible by 1 beat, the piece is in simple time. The most common rhythmic value representing one beat is the quarter note. Therefore, the bottom number of the time signature is 4.

Now, let's count the beats in each measure:

* Measure 1: 2 beats
* Measure 2: 3 beats
* Measure 3: 2 beats
* Measure 4: 2 beats

The time signature is not consistent throughout the piece. Measures 1, 3, and 4 have two beats, while measure 2 has three beats. The most likely time signatures are 2/4 and 3/4, alternating throughout the piece.

**Summary:**

The key of the piece is E minor. The time signature alternates between 2/4 and 3/4.
