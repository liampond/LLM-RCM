**Key Analysis:**

1. **Key Signature:** The key signature has one sharp.  According to the table, this corresponds to G major or E minor.

2. **Major or Minor:**  The piece prominently features the notes of the G major scale (G, A, B, C, D, E, F#). There is no raised 7th degree of E minor (D#) present. This strongly suggests G major.

3. **Other Clues:** The piece begins and ends on G, the tonic of G major.  The melodic and harmonic content also aligns with G major.

**Time Signature Analysis:**

1. **Identify Beat Groupings:** The music contains various rhythmic groupings. Let's analyze the first measure:

* (16th, 16th, 16th, 16th): Four 16th notes beamed together suggest a quarter note beat.
* (16th, 16th, 16th, 16th): Another group of four 16th notes reinforces the quarter note beat.
* (16th, 16th, 16th, 16th): A third group of four 16th notes further confirms the quarter note beat.

2. **Check Total Value:** Each beamed group adds up to a quarter note (1.0). This indicates simple time. Since one beat equals a quarter note, the bottom number of the time signature will be 4.

3. **Count Total Beats:**  In the first measure, there are three groups of four 16th notes, totaling 12 sixteenth notes or 3 quarter notes. This suggests a triple meter.

4. **Write Time Signature:** Combining the top number (3 beats) and the bottom number (quarter note), the time signature is 3/4.

**Summary:**

The key of the piece is G major. The time signature is 3/4.
