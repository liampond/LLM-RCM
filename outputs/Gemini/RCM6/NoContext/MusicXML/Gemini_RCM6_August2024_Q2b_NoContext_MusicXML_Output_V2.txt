Measure 1: 4/4
Measure 2: 4/4


The first measure contains a dotted quarter note (12/8), an eighth note (4/8), two sixteenth notes (2/8 + 2/8), an eighth note (4/8), and two eighth notes (4/8 + 4/8).  Summing these gives 32/8, equivalent to 4/4.

The second measure contains two sixteenth notes (4/8), two 32nd notes (1/8 + 1/8), a dotted sixteenth note and a 32nd note (3/8 + 1/8), a sixteenth note (2/8), an eighth note (4/8), and a sixteenth note (2/8). Summing these gives 16/8, equivalent to 2/2 or 4/4.  Since the first measure is in 4/4, it is more likely that the second measure is also in 4/4 rather than 2/2.
