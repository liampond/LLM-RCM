Measure 1: 4/4
Measure 2: 4/4


The total duration of notes in measure 1 is 32 16th notes (12+4+2+2+4+4+4 = 32).  Since the piece defaults to using 16th notes as divisions, a time signature of x/4 implies that each measure contains a total duration equivalent to 4x quarter notes, or 16x 16th notes.  Thus, the time signature must be 4/4 (x=4).

Similarly, the total duration of the notes in measure 2 is also 32 16th notes (2+2+1+1+3+1+2+4+2+8 = 32).  Thus, the time signature must also be 4/4.
