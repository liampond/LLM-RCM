**Key:** F# minor

**Time Signature:** 2/4

**Summary:** The melody, entirely in sixteenth notes and eighth notes, implies a duple meter.  Given the consistent grouping of sixteenth notes into four-note sets, and the presence of the eighth notes (equal to two sixteenths), 2/4 is the most appropriate time signature. The key is determined by the key signature of one sharp, and the prominent use of F# as the tonic.
