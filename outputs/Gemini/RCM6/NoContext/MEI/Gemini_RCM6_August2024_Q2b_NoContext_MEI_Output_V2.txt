Measure 1: 4/4
Measure 2: 4/4

**Explanation:**

* **Measure 1:** Contains a dotted quarter note (12/8 = 3/4 of a whole note), an eighth note (4/8 = 1/4 of a whole note), followed by notes totaling another quarter note.  This adds up to 4/4.

* **Measure 2:**  All the notes in the second measure add up to a whole note's value (sixteenth notes, a dotted eighth, thirty-second notes, etc. - the total duration is equivalent to 32/32). This also indicates a 4/4 time signature.
