**Key:** G major

**Time Signature:** 3/4

**Summary:**

The melody is in G major, as indicated by the one-sharp key signature.  The time signature is 3/4. This is determined by adding the note durations in each measure. Measure one contains a sixteenth rest and five sixteenth notes, totaling six sixteenth notes (equivalent to 3 eighth notes or, with a proper time signature, 3 quarter notes). Measure two contains six sixteenth notes. Measure three contains two 32nd notes, a sixteenth note, and an eighth note, again totaling 3 eighth notes. Measure four follows the same pattern as measure three.  Thus, 3/4 is the most appropriate time signature.
