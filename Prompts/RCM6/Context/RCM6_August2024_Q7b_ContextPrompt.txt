Guide to Determining the Key of a Piece of Music
Determining the key of a piece is a fundamental skill in music theory. Follow these steps to identify the key, distinguishing between major and minor keys:

1. Check the Key Signature
Look at the key signature at the beginning of the piece (next to the clef).
Count the number of sharps (#) or flats (♭) in the key signature.
Use the table below to match the sharps or flats to their corresponding major and minor keys.
Sharps        | Major Key   | Minor Key   || Flats        | Major Key   | Minor Key
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0             | C Major     | A Minor     || 0            | C Major     | A Minor
1             | G Major     | E Minor     || 1            | F Major     | D Minor
2             | D Major     | B Minor     || 2            | B♭ Major    | G Minor
3             | A Major     | F♯ Minor    || 3            | E♭ Major    | C Minor
4             | E Major     | C♯ Minor    || 4            | A♭ Major    | F Minor
5             | B Major     | G♯ Minor    || 5            | D♭ Major    | B♭ Minor
6             | F♯ Major    | D♯ Minor    || 6            | G♭ Major    | E♭ Minor
7             | C♯ Major    | A♯ Minor    || 7            | C♭ Major    | A♭ Minor


2. Determine if the Key is Major or Minor
Once you've identified the possible key from the key signature, decide whether the piece is in the major key or its relative minor.
Look for the raised seventh degree:
In minor keys, the seventh note of the scale is typically raised by a half step, creating a leading tone that resolves to the tonic. This is often indicated by an accidental (a sharp or natural sign not in the key signature).
For example:
If the key signature has no sharps or flats (C Major / A Minor), and you see a G♯ in the piece, the key is A Minor (G♯ is the raised seventh in A Minor).
If there are no such accidentals, the key is likely the major key.

3. Look for Other Clues
If you're unsure after checking the raised seventh, consider these additional hints:
Melodic and Harmonic Content:
Minor keys often emphasize minor triads (e.g., A-C-E for A Minor).
Look for chord progressions common to minor keys, such as i-iv-V-i (e.g., A Minor: Am-Dm-E-Am).
Starting and Ending Notes/Chords:
Many pieces start and end on the tonic note or chord of the key.
If a piece starts and ends on A Minor chords, it is likely in A Minor.

How to Determine an Unknown Time Signature: A Step-by-Step Guide
When you’re working with an unknown time signature, analyzing the rhythmic values and beat groupings is key. Follow these steps to determine the time signature:

Step 1: Identify the Beat Groupings
Look at the beamed notes (notes connected by beams). These groupings reveal how the beats are structured within the measure.
Add up the rhythmic values of all the notes under one beam to determine how much time they represent.

Step 2: Check the Total Value of the Beam Groupings
Determine whether the time is simple or compound based on the total rhythmic value of each grouping:
Simple Time
If the total value of a single beam grouping is 1, 2, or 0.5, you are in simple time.
In simple time:
Each beam grouping represents one beat.
The bottom number of the time signature is determined by the value of one beat:
If one beat = a quarter note (1), the bottom number is 4.
If one beat = an eighth note (0.5), the bottom number is 8.
If one beat = a half note (2), the bottom number is 2.
Compound Time
If the total value of a single beam grouping is 3, 1.5, or 0.75, you are in compound time.
In compound time:
Each beam grouping represents three smaller beats combined into one larger beat.
The value of one smaller beat determines the bottom number of the time signature:
If one smaller beat = a sixteenth note (0.25), the bottom number is 16.
If one smaller beat = an eighth note (0.5), the bottom number is 8.
If one smaller beat = a quarter note (1), the bottom number is 4.

Key Addition: Identify the Beat Value That Represents One Full Beat
To determine the bottom number, carefully analyze how the beats are grouped:
The bottom number represents the note value of one full beat, not necessarily the smallest rhythmic value in the measure.
For example:
If four sixteenth notes make up one beat, the bottom number would still be 4 (a quarter note) if the rhythm groups them into one quarter note.
Likewise, if two eighth notes form one beat, the bottom number would be 8.
This distinction is important because the time signature reflects the structural grouping of beats, not just the smallest subdivision present.

Step 3: Count the Total Beats in the Measure
Count the total number of smaller beats (the smallest note value corresponding to the bottom number of the time signature) in the measure.
This includes adding up all the rhythmic values in terms of the smallest beat (e.g., 16ths for a bottom number of 16, 8ths for a bottom number of 8).
In Simple Time:
Each beam grouping equals one beat. Add up the number of beats in the measure.
In Compound Time:
Each beam grouping equals three smaller beats. Add up the total number of smaller beats across all groupings.
The top number of the time signature is the total number of smaller beats in the measure.

Step 4: Write the Time Signature
Combine the top number (total number of smaller beats in the measure) with the bottom number (the note value for one smaller beat).
If the total number of smaller beats suggests simple time (e.g., grouped in twos or fours), write the time signature accordingly.
If the total number of smaller beats suggests compound time (e.g., grouped in threes), reflect that in the time signature.

Here are some examples:

Given Rhythmic Groupings
(16th, dotted 16th, 32nd)
(8th, 16th)
(16th, 16th, 16th)

Step 1: Analyze Each Beam Grouping
Group 1: 16th, dotted 16th, 32nd
A 16th note = 0.25 beats.
A dotted 16th note = 0.25 + 0.125 = 0.375 beats.
A 32nd note = 0.125 beats.
Total value = 0.25 + 0.375 + 0.125 = 0.75 beats.
Since the total is 0.75 beats, this grouping equals three 16th notes.

Group 2: Eighth, Sixteenth
An eighth note = 0.5 beats.
A sixteenth note = 0.25 beats.
Total value = 0.5 + 0.25 = 0.75 beats.
This grouping also equals three 16th notes.

Group 3: 16th, 16th, 16th
Each 16th note = 0.25 beats.
Total value = 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 = 0.75 beats.
This grouping equals three 16th notes as well.

Step 2: Determine the Bottom Number
Each smaller beat is a 16th note, so the bottom number of the time signature is 16.

Step 3: Count the Total Beats in the Measure
Count the total number of 16th notes in the measure. Each grouping equals three 16ths, and there are three groupings:
3 groupings × 3 16ths per grouping = 9 16ths total.
The top number of the time signature is therefore 9.

Step 4: Write the Time Signature
Combine the top number (total number of 16ths in the measure) with the bottom number (smallest beat value). The time signature is:
9/16

Final Answer
The time signature for the rhythm provided is 9/16, indicating a compound meter with three beats per measure, each divided into three 16th notes.
—--
Example 2:

Given Rhythmic Groupings
(Dotted sixteenth, 32nd, eighth)
(Dotted eighth, sixteenth)

Step 1: Analyze Each Beam Grouping
Group 1: Dotted sixteenth, 32nd, eighth
A dotted sixteenth note = 3/32.
A 32nd note = 1/32.
An eighth note = 4/32.
Total value = 3/32 + 1/32 + 4/32 = 8/32 = 1/4.
This grouping equals 1/4 of a measure.

Group 2: Dotted eighth, sixteenth
A dotted eighth note = 3/16.
A sixteenth note = 1/16.
Total value = 3/16 + 1/16 = 4/16 = 1/4.
This grouping equals 1/4 of a measure.

Step 2: Add Up the Total Value of the Measure
Group 1 = 1/4.
Group 2 = 1/4.
Total = 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2.
The total rhythmic value of the measure is 1/2 of a whole note.

Step 3: Determine the Bottom Number
The measure adds up to 1/2 of a whole note, meaning the note value for 1 beat must be a quarter note (1/4). Thus, the bottom number of the time signature is 4.

Step 4: Count the Total Beats in the Measure
Each grouping equals 1/4 of a whole note, so there are 2 beats in the measure.
The top number of the time signature is 2, as there are 2 beats in the measure.

Step 5: Write the Time Signature
Combine the top number (2 beats) with the bottom number (4, representing a quarter note). The time signature is:
2/4

Final Answer
The time signature for the rhythm provided is 2/4, indicating 2 beats per measure, with each beat represented by a quarter note.
—--
Last example:

Given Rhythmic Groupings
(Quarter, dotted quarter, eighth)
(16th, 16th, 8th, quarter, 8th, 8th)

Step 1: Analyze Each Beam Grouping
Group 1: Quarter, dotted quarter, eighth
A quarter note = 1 beat.
A dotted quarter note = 1.5 beats (3 eighths).
An eighth note = 0.5 beats.
Total value = 1 + 1.5 + 0.5 = 3 beats.
This grouping equals 3 beats.

Group 2: 16th, 16th, 8th, quarter, 8th, 8th
A 16th note = 0.25 beats (each).
An 8th note = 0.5 beats (each).
A quarter note = 1 beat.
Total value:
16th + 16th = 0.25 + 0.25 = 0.5
0.5 (eighth)
1 (quarter)
0.5 + 0.5 (two eighths)
Total = 0.5 + 0.5 + 1 + 0.5 + 0.5 = 3 beats.
This grouping also equals 3 beats.

Step 2: Add Up the Total Value of the Measure
Group 1 = 3 beats.
Group 2 = 3 beats.
Total = 3 + 3 = 6 beats.
The total value of the measure is 6 beats.

Step 3: Determine the Bottom Number
To find the bottom number, consider the note value of one beat. Since the rhythm is grouped into clear beats of 1 beat each, and a quarter note represents 1 beat, the bottom number of the time signature is 4.

Step 4: Count the Total Beats in the Measure
Since the measure contains 6 beats, the top number of the time signature is 6.

Step 5: Write the Time Signature
Combine the top number (6 beats) with the bottom number (quarter note as the beat unit). The time signature is:
6/4

Guide to Determining Root and Quality Chord Symbols from a Melody
Determining the implied chord from a melody involves identifying the underlying harmonic structure that supports the melody. In this guide, we will focus on triads (major, minor, diminished, or augmented) and how to differentiate between chord tones and non-chord tones.

Step 1: Analyze the Melody in the Given Bar
Identify the Notes: Write out all the pitches in the melody for the bar.
Determine the Metric Placement:
Strong beats: Notes that land on strong beats (e.g., beats 1 and 3 in 4/4 time) are more likely to be chord tones.
Weak beats: Notes on weaker beats (e.g., beats 2 and 4) or off-beats are more likely to be non-chord tones, though not always.
Observe Range and Extremes:
The highest and lowest notes in the bar are often chord tones, as they tend to anchor the harmony.
Account for Rhythmic Emphasis: Notes held longer or with greater rhythmic prominence are more likely to belong to the chord.

Step 2: Differentiate Chord Tones and Non-Chord Tones
Non-chord tones (NCTs) are melodic embellishments that do not belong to the underlying chord. Common types of NCTs include:
Passing Tones (PT): Stepwise notes connecting two chord tones (e.g., A-B-C, where B is the passing tone).
Neighbor Tones (NT): Notes that step away from a chord tone and return (e.g., G-A-G, where A is the neighbor tone).
Suspensions (SUS): Notes that delay resolution by holding a previous chord tone before stepping down to the actual chord tone (e.g., F-E in a C major chord).
Anticipations (ANT): Notes that resolve early, landing on a chord tone of the next harmony.
Appoggiaturas (APP): Non-chord tones approached by a leap and resolved by a step (e.g., G-E over a C major chord).
Escape Tones (ET): Notes approached by step and resolved by a leap in the opposite direction.

Step 3: Look for Patterns to Infer the Chord
Group the Chord Tones: After identifying the likely chord tones (based on metric placement, range, and prominence), group them into sets of three.
Find a Root and Quality:
Arrange the chord tones into a triad (stacked in thirds).
Identify the root, third, and fifth to determine the chord quality:
Major triad: Root–Major 3rd–Perfect 5th.
Minor triad: Root–Minor 3rd–Perfect 5th.
Diminished triad: Root–Minor 3rd–Diminished 5th.
Augmented triad: Root–Major 3rd–Augmented 5th.

Step 4: Verify with the Melody's Movement
Check for Compatibility: Ensure the chord makes sense with the melodic contour and avoids dissonances (e.g., a diminished triad might clash if the melody emphasizes consonance).
Simplify if Necessary: If multiple chords seem possible, choose the one that fits the overall harmonic context or simplifies the progression.

Example Walkthrough
Melody in C Major:
Bar 1 Notes: G, A, B, C
Time Signature: 4/4
Identify Notes and Placement:
Beat 1: G (strong beat)
Beat 2: A (weak beat)
Beat 3: B (strong beat)
Beat 4: C (weak beat)
Analyze Range:
Lowest note: G
Highest note: C
Identify Chord Tones:
Strong beats: G and B (likely chord tones)
Weak beats: A and C (A is likely a passing tone; C could be a chord tone).
Infer the Chord:
Chord tones: G, B, and C suggest a C major chord (C-E-G).
A is a passing tone connecting G and B.

Practice Tips
Look for stepwise motion to identify passing and neighbor tones.
Focus on downbeats and longer notes to determine chord tones.
Practice analyzing simpler melodies and progress to more complex ones.
By following this systematic approach, you can accurately determine the root and quality of chords implied by a melody.

Here are some examples:
Melody:
Beat 1-2: D (quarter note, sustained across beats 1 and 2)
Beat 3: F# (eighth note)
Beat 4: A (eighth note)
Beat 5: G (eighth note)
Beat 6: F# (eighth note)

Step 1: Identify Notes and Metric Placement
In 6/8 time, the strong beats are:
Beat 1 (strong): D (sustained across beats 1–2).
Beat 4 (strong): A (eighth note).
These strong beats (D and A) are likely chord tones. The other notes (F#, G, and F#) may include non-chord tones.

Step 2: Determine the Range
Lowest Note: D → Likely the root or fifth of the chord.
Highest Note: A → Likely the fifth or third of the chord.

Step 3: Differentiate Chord Tones and Non-Chord Tones
Let’s evaluate the role of each note:
D (beats 1–2): A strong beat and sustained note → Likely a chord tone (likely the root).
F# (beat 3): Approached stepwise from D → Likely a chord tone (major third of D major).
A (beat 4): Strong beat → Likely a chord tone (fifth of D major).
G (beat 5): A step down from A → Likely a passing tone.
F# (beat 6): Resolves back to a chord tone (major third of D major).

Step 4: Infer the Chord
The notes D, F#, A (on beats 1, 3, and 4) clearly outline a D major triad:
Root: D
Third: F#
Fifth: A
The G (beat 5) functions as a non-chord tone:
G: A passing tone between A and F#.

Final Answer:
The chord implied by the melody is D major.
Non-chord tones (G and the second F#) serve to embellish the D major harmony without altering its root or quality.
So you would write ‘D’.

Example 2:

Melody:
Beat 1: G (eighth note)
Beat 2: A (eighth note)
Beat 3: B♭ (eighth note)
Beat 4: D (eighth note)
Beat 5: C (eighth note)
Beat 6: B♭ (eighth note)

Step 1: Identify Metric Placement
In 6/8 time, the strong beats are:
Beat 1 (strong): G
Beat 4 (strong): D
These strong beats are likely chord tones.

Step 2: Determine the Range
Lowest Note: G
Highest Note: D
This range suggests the notes are part of a chord containing G and D, with additional possibilities depending on the other notes.

Step 3: Differentiate Chord Tones and Non-Chord Tones
Let’s analyze each note:
G (beat 1): Strong beat and lowest note → Likely the root of the chord.
A (beat 2): Stepwise approach to B♭ → Likely a passing tone.
B♭ (beat 3): Prepares for the leap to D → Likely a chord tone.
D (beat 4): Strong beat and highest note → Likely a chord tone (fifth of G minor).
C (beat 5): Stepwise motion down to B♭ → Likely a passing tone.
B♭ (beat 6): Resolves to a chord tone (third of G minor).

Step 4: Infer the Chord
Chord tones: G, B♭, D.
This outlines a G minor triad (root: G, third: B♭, fifth: D).
Non-chord tones: A (beat 2) and C (beat 5) act as passing tones connecting the chord tones.

Final Answer:
The chord implied by the melody is G minor.
The passing tones A and C create melodic movement without altering the underlying harmonic structure of G minor.
