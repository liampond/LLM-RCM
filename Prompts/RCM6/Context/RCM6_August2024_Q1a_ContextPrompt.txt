I am going to ask you to determine the intervals between the notes in each measure of the file. However, I will first provide a step-by-step guide on how to determine the intervals.

Step 1: Identify the Notes in the File
Recognize the two notes you are comparing. For example, C and E.

Step 2: Determine the Interval Number
Count the letter names of the two notes, ignoring accidentals, starting from the lower note as 1. Include both the starting and ending notes.

Example: From C to E: C (1), D (2), E (3). This is a third.

Step 3.
To determine the quality of a musical interval, follow these detailed steps, with particular attention to accidentals (sharps, flats, and naturals):

Step 3.1: Use the Major Scale of the Lower Note
Start with the lower note and imagine or recall its major scale.
Example: For C, the major scale is C, D, E, F, G, A, B.
Check where the higher note falls in relation to the notes in this major scale:
If the higher note matches the note in the major scale, the interval is either:
Perfect (unison, 4th, 5th, octave).
Major (2nd, 3rd, 6th, 7th).
Example 1: In the C major scale, the note G is the 5th. C to G is a Perfect fifth.
Example 2: In the C major scale, the note E is the 3rd. C to E is a Major third.

Step 3.2: Adjust for Accidentals
Accidentals affect the higher note's position relative to the major scale. This determines whether the interval becomes minor, diminished, or augmented.
Perfect Intervals (Unison, 4th, 5th, Octave):
If the higher note is lowered by one semitone: The interval becomes Diminished.
Example: In the C major scale, G is the 5th. If G is lowered to G♭, the interval becomes a Diminished fifth.
If the higher note is raised by one semitone: The interval becomes Augmented.
Example: In the C major scale, G is the 5th. If G is raised to G♯, the interval becomes an Augmented fifth.
Major Intervals (2nd, 3rd, 6th, 7th):
If the higher note is lowered by one semitone: The interval becomes Minor.
Example: In the C major scale, E is the 3rd. If E is lowered to E♭, the interval becomes a Minor third.
If the higher note is lowered by two semitones: The interval becomes Diminished.
Example: In the C major scale, E is the 3rd. If E is lowered to E♭♭ (double flat), the interval becomes a Diminished third.
If the higher note is raised by one semitone: The interval becomes Augmented.
Example: In the C major scale, E is the 3rd. If E is raised to E♯, the interval becomes an Augmented third.

Step 3.3: Compare Accidentals Between the Notes
Accidentals on the lower note also affect the starting point of the interval:
If the lower note is raised or lowered, treat it as if the note itself has shifted.
Example: If the lower note is C♯ (not C), the major scale shifts to C♯, D♯, E♯, F♯, G♯, A♯, B♯.
Recalculate the interval by comparing the higher note to the adjusted major scale of the lower note.

Step 3.4: Combine Interval Number and Quality
After accounting for accidentals, determine the final number (e.g., second, third) and quality (e.g., Major, Minor, Perfect, Augmented, or Diminished).

Step 4: Adjust for Accidentals
Check the accidentals (sharps or flats) on either note and adjust the quality:

If the accidental alters the relationship to the major scale, adjust the quality accordingly (Major ↔ Minor, Perfect ↔ Augmented/Diminished).

Example: From C♯ to E:

In the C♯ major scale (C♯, D♯, E♯, F♯, G♯, A♯, B♯), E is not present—it is a semitone lower than E♯. Therefore, the interval is Minor third.
Step 5: Combine the Number and Quality
State the interval by combining the number (Step 2) and the quality (Step 3).

Example: C to E is a Major third, while C to E♭ is a Minor third.

Now, here are some examples of how you would determine the interval.

Example: Determining the Interval Between D♯ and D𝄪 (D Double Sharp), Same Octave

Step 1: Identify the Notes in the File
The two notes are D♯ (lower note) and D𝄪 (higher note).

Step 2: Determine the Interval Number
Count the letter names, starting with the lower note as 1.
D (1) → D (still D).
Since the letter name remains the same, this is a Unison.

Step 3: Determine the Quality of the Interval
Reference the D♯ Major Scale:
The D♯ major scale is: D♯, E♯, F𝄪, G♯, A♯, B♯, C𝄪.
In this scale, D♯ (the lower note) and D♯ (unison) would be the same note.
Compare D𝄪 to D♯:
D𝄪 is one semitone higher than D♯.
A Perfect unison raised by one semitone becomes an Augmented unison.

Step 4: Adjust for Accidentals
The accidental double sharp (𝄪) on the higher note already indicates the pitch is raised by two semitones relative to natural D, so this reinforces the interval as Augmented.

Step 5: Combine the Number and Quality
The interval is a Unison (from Step 2).
The quality is Augmented (from Step 3).
Final Answer: The interval between D♯ and D𝄪 is an Augmented unison.

Here's another example

Example: Determining the Interval Between D and A♭

Step 1: Identify the Notes in the File
The two notes are D (lower note) and A♭ (higher note).

Step 2: Determine the Interval Number
Count the letter names, starting with D as 1:
D (1), E (2), F (3), G (4), A (5).
The interval number is a fifth.

Step 3: Determine the Quality of the Interval
Reference the D Major Scale:
The D major scale is: D, E, F♯, G, A, B, C♯.
In this scale, A is the 5th note. D to A is a Perfect fifth.
Compare A♭ to A:
A♭ is one semitone lower than A.
Lowering a Perfect fifth by one semitone makes it a Diminished fifth.

Step 4: Combine the Number and Quality
The interval is a Fifth (from Step 2).
The quality is Diminished (from Step 3).
Final Answer: The interval between D and A♭ is a Diminished fifth.

Here's one last example:

Step 1: Identify the Notes
The two notes are G♯ (lower note) and E (higher note).

Step 2: Determine the Interval Number
Count the letter names, starting with G as 1:
G (1), A (2), B (3), C (4), D (5), E (6).
The interval number is a sixth.

Step 3: Determine the Quality of the Interval
Reference the G♯ Major Scale:
The G♯ major scale is: G♯, A♯, B♯, C♯, D♯, E♯, F𝄪.
In this scale, E♯ is the 6th note.
Compare E to E♯:
E is one semitone lower than E♯.
Lowering a Major sixth by one semitone makes it a Minor sixth.

Step 4: Combine the Number and Quality
The interval is a Sixth (from Step 2).
The quality is Minor (from Step 3).
Final Answer: The interval between G♯ and E is a Minor sixth.
