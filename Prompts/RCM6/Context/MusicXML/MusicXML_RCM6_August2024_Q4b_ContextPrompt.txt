Transpose the melody in the score up to A flat major using the correct key signature. Be precise about the notes and the rhythms. Name the interval of transposition.
Return a the new transposed music in the specified format.

To determine the interval of transposition, you must find the interval between the original key and the new key. For example, if the original key is C, and you are transposing to F, you need to find the interval from C to F.
Here is a guide on how to find an interval:

I am going to ask you to determine the intervals between the notes in each measure of the file. However, I will first provide a step-by-step guide on how to determine the intervals.

Step 1: Identify the Notes in the File
Recognize the two notes you are comparing. For example, C and E.

Step 2: Determine the Interval Number
Count the letter names of the two notes, ignoring accidentals, starting from the lower note as 1. Include both the starting and ending notes.

Example: From C to E: C (1), D (2), E (3). This is a third.

Step 3.
To determine the quality of a musical interval, follow these detailed steps, with particular attention to accidentals (sharps, flats, and naturals):

Step 3.1: Use the Major Scale of the Lower Note
Start with the lower note and imagine or recall its major scale.
Example: For C, the major scale is C, D, E, F, G, A, B.
Check where the higher note falls in relation to the notes in this major scale:
If the higher note matches the note in the major scale, the interval is either:
Perfect (unison, 4th, 5th, octave).
Major (2nd, 3rd, 6th, 7th).
Example 1: In the C major scale, the note G is the 5th. C to G is a Perfect fifth.
Example 2: In the C major scale, the note E is the 3rd. C to E is a Major third.

Step 3.2: Adjust for Accidentals
Accidentals affect the higher note's position relative to the major scale. This determines whether the interval becomes minor, diminished, or augmented.
Perfect Intervals (Unison, 4th, 5th, Octave):
If the higher note is lowered by one semitone: The interval becomes Diminished.
Example: In the C major scale, G is the 5th. If G is lowered to G♭, the interval becomes a Diminished fifth.
If the higher note is raised by one semitone: The interval becomes Augmented.
Example: In the C major scale, G is the 5th. If G is raised to G♯, the interval becomes an Augmented fifth.
Major Intervals (2nd, 3rd, 6th, 7th):
If the higher note is lowered by one semitone: The interval becomes Minor.
Example: In the C major scale, E is the 3rd. If E is lowered to E♭, the interval becomes a Minor third.
If the higher note is lowered by two semitones: The interval becomes Diminished.
Example: In the C major scale, E is the 3rd. If E is lowered to E♭♭ (double flat), the interval becomes a Diminished third.
If the higher note is raised by one semitone: The interval becomes Augmented.
Example: In the C major scale, E is the 3rd. If E is raised to E♯, the interval becomes an Augmented third.

Step 3.3: Compare Accidentals Between the Notes
Accidentals on the lower note also affect the starting point of the interval:
If the lower note is raised or lowered, treat it as if the note itself has shifted.
Example: If the lower note is C♯ (not C), the major scale shifts to C♯, D♯, E♯, F♯, G♯, A♯, B♯.
Recalculate the interval by comparing the higher note to the adjusted major scale of the lower note.

Step 3.4: Combine Interval Number and Quality
After accounting for accidentals, determine the final number (e.g., second, third) and quality (e.g., Major, Minor, Perfect, Augmented, or Diminished).

Step 4: Adjust for Accidentals
Check the accidentals (sharps or flats) on either note and adjust the quality:

If the accidental alters the relationship to the major scale, adjust the quality accordingly (Major ↔ Minor, Perfect ↔ Augmented/Diminished).

Example: From C♯ to E:

In the C♯ major scale (C♯, D♯, E♯, F♯, G♯, A♯, B♯), E is not present—it is a semitone lower than E♯. Therefore, the interval is Minor third.
Step 5: Combine the Number and Quality
State the interval by combining the number (Step 2) and the quality (Step 3).

Example: C to E is a Major third, while C to E♭ is a Minor third.

-----
Now, here are some examples of how you would determine the interval.

Example: Determining the Interval Between D♯ and D𝄪 (D Double Sharp), Same Octave

Step 1: Identify the Notes in the File
The two notes are D♯ (lower note) and D𝄪 (higher note).

Step 2: Determine the Interval Number
Count the letter names, starting with the lower note as 1.
D (1) → D (still D).
Since the letter name remains the same, this is a Unison.

Step 3: Determine the Quality of the Interval
Reference the D♯ Major Scale:
The D♯ major scale is: D♯, E♯, F𝄪, G♯, A♯, B♯, C𝄪.
In this scale, D♯ (the lower note) and D♯ (unison) would be the same note.
Compare D𝄪 to D♯:
D𝄪 is one semitone higher than D♯.
A Perfect unison raised by one semitone becomes an Augmented unison.

Step 4: Adjust for Accidentals
The accidental double sharp (𝄪) on the higher note already indicates the pitch is raised by two semitones relative to natural D, so this reinforces the interval as Augmented.

Step 5: Combine the Number and Quality
The interval is a Unison (from Step 2).
The quality is Augmented (from Step 3).
Final Answer: The interval between D♯ and D𝄪 is an Augmented unison.

-----
Here's another example

Example: Determining the Interval Between D and A♭

Step 1: Identify the Notes in the File
The two notes are D (lower note) and A♭ (higher note).

Step 2: Determine the Interval Number
Count the letter names, starting with D as 1:
D (1), E (2), F (3), G (4), A (5).
The interval number is a fifth.

Step 3: Determine the Quality of the Interval
Reference the D Major Scale:
The D major scale is: D, E, F♯, G, A, B, C♯.
In this scale, A is the 5th note. D to A is a Perfect fifth.
Compare A♭ to A:
A♭ is one semitone lower than A.
Lowering a Perfect fifth by one semitone makes it a Diminished fifth.

Step 4: Combine the Number and Quality
The interval is a Fifth (from Step 2).
The quality is Diminished (from Step 3).
Final Answer: The interval between D and A♭ is a Diminished fifth.
-----
Here's one last example:

Step 1: Identify the Notes
The two notes are G♯ (lower note) and E (higher note).

Step 2: Determine the Interval Number
Count the letter names, starting with G as 1:
G (1), A (2), B (3), C (4), D (5), E (6).
The interval number is a sixth.

Step 3: Determine the Quality of the Interval
Reference the G♯ Major Scale:
The G♯ major scale is: G♯, A♯, B♯, C♯, D♯, E♯, F𝄪.
In this scale, E♯ is the 6th note.
Compare E to E♯:
E is one semitone lower than E♯.
Lowering a Major sixth by one semitone makes it a Minor sixth.

Step 4: Combine the Number and Quality
The interval is a Sixth (from Step 2).
The quality is Minor (from Step 3).
Final Answer: The interval between G♯ and E is a Minor sixth.

The interval of transposition is down a minor third.

------

In order to transpose the melody, you need to adjust all of the original notes by the interval of transposition.

As a reminder, transpose the melody in the score up to A flat major using the correct key signature. Be precise about the notes and the rhythms. Name the interval of transposition. Return a new transposed score in the specified format.
