I am going to ask you to answer the following questions about writing chords. YOu will need to make a file in the specified format

Guide to Writing Chords
Step 1: Identify the Root Note
Determine the key: Check whether the given key is major or minor.
Write the scale:
If the key is major, write out the major scale.
If the key is minor, write out the harmonic minor scale.
Find the scale degree using the following chart:
1 = Tonic
2 = Supertonic
3 = Mediant
4 = Subdominant
5 = Dominant
6 = Submediant
Natural 7 = Subtonic (only in natural minor)
Raised 7th = Leading tone (used in harmonic minor and major scales)
Match the requested chord type (e.g., dominant = 5th note of the scale) with the corresponding scale degree.

Step 2: Write the Notes of the Chord
For a triad (three notes):
The root note = scale degree of the chord.
The third = 3rd note in the scale, starting from the root (skip one note).
The fifth = 5th note in the scale, starting from the root.
If the scale wraps around, continue counting from the beginning.
For a seventh chord (four notes):
Add the seventh = 7th note in the scale, starting from the root.
In minor keys:
If the chord includes the seventh scale degree, remember that in harmonic minor, this note must be raised with an accidental (e.g., F# instead of F in A minor).

Step 3: Determine the Inversion
Root position:
Write the chord in closed position: Root, third, fifth, (seventh if applicable).
First inversion:
Reorder the notes in closed position: The third of the chord becomes the lowest note.
Order: Third, fifth, root, (seventh).
Second inversion:
Reorder the notes in closed position: The fifth of the chord becomes the lowest note.
Order: Fifth, root, third, (seventh).
Third inversion (only for seventh chords):
Reorder the notes in closed position: The seventh of the chord becomes the lowest note.
Order: Seventh, root, third, fifth.
Important: Only the above closed-position orders are acceptable. Any other order is not correct for inversions.

Step 4: Apply Accidentals
In minor keys:
If you use the raised 7th scale degree (leading tone) as part of the chord, it requires an accidental (e.g., G# in A minor).
Dominant chords in minor keys:
The third of the dominant chord will always include the raised 7th scale degree.

Here’s an example:
How to find the mediant chord of D major in first inversion:

Step 1: Identify the Root Note
Determine the key: The key is D major.
Write the scale of D major:
The notes in the D major scale are: D, E, F#, G, A, B, C#, D.
Find the mediant chord:
The mediant is the 3rd scale degree.
The 3rd scale degree in D major is F#, so F# is the root note of the mediant chord.

Step 2: Write the Notes of the Chord
The chord is a triad, so it will have three notes: root, third, and fifth.
Root note = F# (3rd scale degree).
To find the third of the chord:
Start from F# and count the 3rd note in the D major scale: F#, G, A → The third is A.
To find the fifth of the chord:
Start from F# and count the 5th note in the D major scale: F#, G, A, B, C# → The fifth is C#.
The mediant chord consists of: F#, A, C#.

Step 3: Determine the Inversion
The question asks for the first inversion, so:
In first inversion, the third of the chord becomes the lowest note.
The notes must be reordered in closed position: A (3rd), C# (5th), F# (root).

Step 4: Final Answer
The mediant chord of D major in first inversion is: A, C#, F#.

Example 2:

ere’s a step-by-step example to solve how to find the submediant chord of B-flat minor in root position:

Step 1: Identify the Root Note
Determine the key: The key is B-flat minor.
Write the scale of B-flat minor:
Since it’s a minor key, use the harmonic minor scale: B♭, C, D♭, E♭, F, G♭, A, B♭.
Find the submediant chord:
The submediant is the 6th scale degree.
The 6th scale degree in B-flat minor is G♭, so G♭ is the root note of the submediant chord.

Step 2: Write the Notes of the Chord
The chord is a triad, so it will have three notes: root, third, and fifth.
Root note = G♭ (6th scale degree).
To find the third of the chord:
Start from G♭ and count the 3rd note in the B-flat harmonic minor scale: G♭, A, B♭ → The third is B♭.
To find the fifth of the chord:
Start from G♭ and count the 5th note in the B-flat harmonic minor scale: G♭, A, B♭, C, D♭ → The fifth is D♭.
The submediant chord consists of: G♭, B♭, D♭.

Step 3: Determine the Inversion
The question asks for root position, so:
In root position, the notes are written in closed position: Root, third, fifth.
Order: G♭, B♭, D♭.

Step 4: Final Answer
The submediant chord of B-flat minor in root position is: G♭, B♭, D♭.

Last example:

Here’s a step-by-step example to solve how to find the dominant seventh chord of A major in third inversion:

Step 1: Identify the Root Note
Determine the key: The key is A major.
Write the scale of A major:
The notes in the A major scale are: A, B, C#, D, E, F#, G#, A.
Find the dominant chord:
The dominant is the 5th scale degree.
The 5th scale degree in A major is E, so E is the root note of the dominant chord.

Step 2: Write the Notes of the Chord
The chord is a dominant seventh, so it will have four notes: root, third, fifth, and seventh.
Root note = E (5th scale degree).
To find the third of the chord:
Start from E and count the 3rd note in the A major scale: E, F#, G# → The third is G#.
To find the fifth of the chord:
Start from E and count the 5th note in the A major scale: E, F#, G#, A, B → The fifth is B.
To find the seventh of the chord:
Start from E and count the 7th note in the A major scale: E, F#, G#, A, B, C#, D → The seventh is D.
The dominant seventh chord consists of: E, G#, B, D.

Step 3: Determine the Inversion
The question asks for third inversion, so:
In third inversion, the seventh of the chord becomes the lowest note.
Reorder the notes in closed position: D (7th), E (root), G# (3rd), B (5th).

Step 4: Final Answer
The dominant seventh chord of A major in third inversion is: D, E, G#, B.
