Each of the quarter notes with x-shaped noteheads in the file represents an unknown placeholder rhythm. Please modify the provided file to add the appropriate rests that would replace the placeholders and complete the bar according to the time signature.
First, I will give you a guide to help you understand which rests to add.

1. Understand the Time Signature
Identify:
The number of beats per measure.
What type of note equals one beat (e.g., in 4/4, a quarter note = 1 beat).

2. Determine the Beat Pattern
Identify the strength of each beat in the time signature:
In simple time (e.g., 4/4):
Beat 1 = strong, Beat 2 = weak, Beat 3 = medium, Beat 4 = weak.
In compound time (e.g., 9/8):
Beat 1 = strong, Beat 2–3 = weak, Beat 4 = medium, Beat 5–6 = weak, Beat 7 = medium, Beat 8–9 = weak.
Note that in compound time (when the first number in the time signature is divisible by 3, beats are grouped into groups of 3). In simple time (for these questions, all other time signatures), they are grouped into groups of two.
This beat pattern determines which rests can combine:
A beat can combine with all weaker (or equal) beats that follow
A beat cannot combine with stronger beats that follow
In triple time signatures (e.g., 3/4), two weak beats cannot combine.

3. Complete the Measure Systematically
Start with incomplete beats:
Finish the first incomplete beat or group of beats: If part of the first beat is provided (e.g., three sixteenth notes in 4/4), add the rest needed to complete that beat (e.g., a sixteenth rest).
Finish the last incomplete beat or group of beats: If the end of the last beat is partially filled (e.g., an eighth note in 4/4), add the rest required to complete it (e.g., an eighth rest).
If part of a group of beats is provided (e.g., a dotted eighth note in 6/8), finish that group of beats. In this case, the first group are the first three beats since 6/8 is compound time, since 6 is divisible by 3. Therefore, we need to finish beats 1-3. Since the second half of beat 2 is very weak and beat three is a weak beat (but still a main beat), we cannot combine these rests, since the strength of the beats is increasing. Therefore, we should add a sixteenth rest followed by an eighth rest.
Fill the middle blank space:
After completing the start and end, analyze the remaining blank space.
Use the largest possible rests while respecting the beat structure determined in Step 2.

4. Verify the Measure
Check that the total duration of notes and rests equals the full measure based on the time signature.

Here is an example in 12/16 where you are given a dotted eighth note followed by a sixteenth note. Then the space. And finally a sixteenth note at the end.
Example: Filling Rests in 12/16
Time Signature: 12/16
Provided Notes:
Dotted eighth note (beats 1–3).
Sixteenth note (beat 4).
Blank space (beats 5–11).
Sixteenth note (beat 12).

Step-by-Step Solution:
1. Determine the Beat Pattern
First, I determine the beat pattern for 12/16, which is the given time signature.
Assign the strength of each beat:
Beat 1: Strong.
Beats 2–3: Weak.
Beat 4: Medium.
Beats 5–6: Weak.
Beat 7: Medium+.
Beats 8–9: Weak.
Beat 10: Medium.
Beat 11: Weak.
Beat 12: Weak.

2. Complete the First Incomplete Section (Beats 4–6)
The sixteenth note on beat 4 starts a new group. To complete beats 4–6:
Since beats 5 and 6 are both weak beats and two weak beats cannot be combined, they cannot be combined so we should put a sixteenth rest on beat 5 and a sixteenth rest on beat 6.

3. Fill the Middle Section (Beats 7–9)
The blank space from beats 7–9 starts at beat 7 (medium+). To fill this group:
Add a dotted eighth rest for beats 7–9 (medium+ + weak + weak).

4. Complete the Last Incomplete Section (Beats 10–12)
The sixteenth note on beat 12 leaves beats 10–11 incomplete. Since beat 10 (medium) is stronger than beat 11 (weak), these beats can be combined:
Add an eighth rest for beats 10–11 (medium + weak).

Final Rest Placement:
Sixteenth rest for beat 5.
Sixteenth rest for beat 6.
Dotted eighth rest for beats 7–9.
Eighth rest for beats 10–11.

Final Solution (Measure Breakdown):
Beats 1–3: Dotted eighth note.
Beat 4: Sixteenth note.
Beat 5: Sixteenth rest.
Beat 6: Sixteenth rest.
Beats 7–9: Dotted eighth rest.
Beats 10–11: Eighth rest.
Beat 12: Sixteenth note.

Provided Notes:
Three triplet eighth notes (beat 1).
Blank space (beats 2–4 and the first half of beat 5).
Dotted quarter note (starting on the second half of beat 5 and spanning all of beat 6).

Step-by-Step Solution:
1. Determine the Beat Pattern
Assign strengths to each beat:
Beat 1: Strong.
Beats 2–3: Weak.
Beat 4: Medium.
Beats 5–6: Weak.

2. Complete the First Incomplete Section (Beats 1–3)
The triplet eighth notes on beat 1 fully occupy that beat.
Beats 2–3 are two weak beats and cannot combine:
Add a quarter rest for beat 2.
Add another quarter rest for beat 3.

3. Complete the Second Half (Beats 4-6)
Beat 4 (medium) and the first half of beat 5 (weak) are empty. Since beat 4 (medium) is stronger than beat 5 (medium, weak), they can be combined.
Add a dotted quarter rest for beat 4, which covers the first half of beat 5

4. Account for the Dotted Quarter Note (Second Half of Beat 5 and Beat 6)
The dotted quarter note starts on the second half of beat 5 and spans 1.5 beats, covering:
The second half of beat 5 (weak).
All of beat 6 (weak).
No additional rests are needed here.

Final Rest Placement:
Quarter rest for beat 2.
Quarter rest for beat 3.
Dotted quarter rest for beat 4 and the first half of beat 5.

One last example:
Question Summary:
Time Signature: 3/4 (Simple Triple Time).
Provided Notes:
Blank space for beats 1 and 2.
Sixteenth note on the second sixteenth subdivision of beat 3.
Eighth note occupying the last two sixteenth-note subdivisions of beat 3.

Step-by-Step Solution Using the New Guide:

1. Understand the Time Signature
3/4 means:
There are 3 beats per measure.
Each beat equals one quarter note (or four sixteenth notes per beat).

2. Determine the Beat Pattern
3/4 Beat Pattern:
Beat 1: Strong.
Beat 2: Weak.
Beat 3: Weak.
Rules for Combining Rests:
A strong beat (beat 1) can combine with a weaker beat (beat 2) that follows.
Two weak beats (like beats 2 and 3) cannot combine in triple time.

3. Complete the Measure Systematically

Step 3a: Finish the First Incomplete Section (Beats 1–2)
Beats 1 and 2 are blank. Since beat 1 (strong) can combine with beat 2 (weak):
Add a half rest to cover both beats 1 and 2.

Step 3b: Complete the Last Incomplete Beat (Beat 3)
Beat 3 currently contains:
A sixteenth note on the second sixteenth subdivision.
An eighth note on the final two sixteenth subdivisions.
To complete the first sixteenth subdivision of beat 3 (blank space):
Add a sixteenth rest.

4. Verify the Measure
Total Duration:
Beats 1–2: Half rest (2 beats).
Beat 3: Sixteenth rest + Sixteenth note + Eighth note.
Total = 3 beats, fulfilling the 3/4 time signature.

Final Rest Placement:
Half rest for beats 1–2.
One sixteenth rest for the first subdivision of beat 3.
