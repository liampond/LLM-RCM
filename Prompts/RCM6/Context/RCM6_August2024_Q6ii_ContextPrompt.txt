How to Determine the Root/Quality Chord Symbol of a Chord
When identifying the root/quality chord symbol of a chord, the process is straightforward, especially if the chords are in root position. Here’s a step-by-step guide:

1. Identify the Root
In root position, the bass note (the lowest note) is always the root of the chord.
Write down the letter name of this note. This will form the starting point of your chord symbol.

2. Determine the Quality of the Chord
To identify the chord's quality (major, minor, or dominant seventh), follow these steps:
Step 2.1: Count the Third Above the Root
Look at the note a third above the root (the second note from the bottom in the chord).
Determine whether it is a minor third or a major third:
A minor third is 3 half steps above the root.
A major third is 4 half steps above the root.
Interval from Root
Quality
Minor third (3 half steps)
Minor
Major third (4 half steps)
Major


Step 2.2: Check the Number of Different Notes
Count how many different notes are in the chord:
If there are 3 different notes (one note may be doubled), it’s a triad.
If there are 4 different notes, it’s likely a dominant seventh chord.
Step 2.3: Check for the Seventh
If there are 4 different notes, examine the top note:
A dominant seventh chord has a minor seventh above the root. A minor seventh is 10 half steps above the root.
Number of Notes
Chord Type
3 (triad)
Major or Minor
4
Dominant Seventh


3. Write the Chord Symbol
Once you know the root and the quality, use the following rules to write the chord symbol:
Triads
Major chord: Write the root’s letter name in uppercase.
Example: C major → C
Minor chord: Write the root’s letter name in uppercase followed by a lowercase m.
Example: A minor → Am
Dominant Seventh Chords
Write the root’s letter name in uppercase followed by a 7.
Example: G dominant seventh → G7

Example 1 for determining root/quality chord symbols:
1. Identify the Root
The bass note is C, so the root of the chord is C.
Write down the root: C.

2. Determine the Quality of the Chord
Step 2.1: Find the Third Above the Root
Look at the note directly above the root:
The note above C is E♭.
Count the half steps between C and E♭:
C → C♯ → D → E♭ = 3 half steps.
A distance of 3 half steps is a minor third.
Step 2.2: Count the Number of Different Notes
The chord contains C, E♭, and G.
There are 3 different notes (C is doubled, but that doesn't count as a new note).
This is a triad (not a seventh chord).

3. Write the Chord Symbol
Since the chord has:
A C root.
A minor third (E♭ above C).
A perfect fifth (G above C).
The chord is a C minor triad.
Write the chord symbol: Cm.

Final Answer:
The chord C (bass), C, E♭, G is Cm (C minor).

Example 2:
1. Identify the Root
The bass note is A♭, so the root of the chord is A♭.
Write down the root: A♭.

2. Determine the Quality of the Chord
Step 2.1: Find the Third Above the Root
Look at the note a third above the root:
The note above A♭ is C.
Count the half steps between A♭ and C:
A♭ → A → B♭ → B → C = 4 half steps.
A distance of 4 half steps is a major third.
Step 2.2: Count the Number of Different Notes
The chord contains A♭, C, and E♭.
There are 3 different notes (A♭, C, E♭).
This is a triad (not a seventh chord).
Step 2.3: Check for the Fifth
The note E♭ is a perfect fifth above A♭ (7 half steps).
This confirms the chord is a major triad.

3. Write the Chord Symbol
Since the chord has:
An A♭ root.
A major third (C above A♭).
A perfect fifth (E♭ above A♭).
The chord is an A♭ major triad.
Write the chord symbol: A♭.

Final Answer:
The chord A♭ (bass), C, E♭, A♭ is A♭ (A-flat major).

Guide to Determining the Key of a Piece of Music
Determining the key of a piece is a fundamental skill in music theory. Follow these steps to identify the key, distinguishing between major and minor keys:

1. Check the Key Signature
Look at the key signature at the beginning of the piece (next to the clef).
Count the number of sharps (#) or flats (♭) in the key signature.
Use the table below to match the sharps or flats to their corresponding major and minor keys.

Flats

2. Determine if the Key is Major or Minor
Once you've identified the possible key from the key signature, decide whether the piece is in the major key or its relative minor.
Look for the raised seventh degree:
In minor keys, the seventh note of the scale is typically raised by a half step, creating a leading tone that resolves to the tonic. This is often indicated by an accidental (a sharp or natural sign not in the key signature).
For example:
If the key signature has no sharps or flats (C Major / A Minor), and you see a G♯ in the piece, the key is A Minor (G♯ is the raised seventh in A Minor).
If there are no such accidentals, the key is likely the major key.

3. Look for Other Clues
If you're unsure after checking the raised seventh, consider these additional hints:
Melodic and Harmonic Content:
Minor keys often emphasize minor triads (e.g., A-C-E for A Minor).
Look for chord progressions common to minor keys, such as i-iv-V-i (e.g., A Minor: Am-Dm-E-Am).
Starting and Ending Notes/Chords:
Many pieces start and end on the tonic note or chord of the key.
If a piece starts and ends on A Minor chords, it is likely in A Minor.

Guide to Determining if a Cadence is Half or Authentic
This guide explains how to determine whether a cadence is half or authentic based on the home key and two root/quality chord symbols. The process involves converting the chord symbols into Roman numerals and analyzing their relationship within the key.

Step-by-Step Process
Write Out the Scale for the Home Key
Identify the home key (e.g., C major, A minor).
Write out the corresponding scale for the key:
Determine the Scale Degree of Each Chord Root
Look at the root of the first and second chord symbols.
Find each root in the written scale and determine its scale degree (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.).
Use the quality (e.g., major, minor) of the chord to assign a Roman numeral:
Uppercase Roman numerals for major chords
Lowercase Roman numerals for minor chords.
Example:
Chord: G major, Home key: C major
Root: G → 5th scale degree → Roman numeral: V
Chord: C major, Home key: C major
Root: C → 1st scale degree → Roman numeral: I
Analyze the Cadence
Look at the second chord (final chord) to determine the type of cadence:
If the second chord is V (dominant): The cadence is half.
If the second chord is I (major tonic) or i (minor tonic): The cadence is authentic.
Example 1 (Half Cadence):
Chord progression: C major → G major
Roman numerals: I → V
Final chord is V → Half Cadence
Example 2 (Authentic Cadence):
Chord progression: G major → C major
Roman numerals: V → I
Final chord is I → Authentic Cadence
Double-Check the Key
Ensure the Roman numerals match the quality and position of the chords in the scale.
In minor keys, be aware of raised leading tones for dominant (V or vii°) chords. For example, in A minor, V is often E major, not E minor.
If you have anything other than i, I or V at the end, you have done something wrong.
