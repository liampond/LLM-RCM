Guide to Determining the Key of a Piece of Music
Determining the key of a piece is a fundamental skill in music theory. Follow these steps to identify the key, distinguishing between major and minor keys:

1. Check the Key Signature
Look at the key signature at the beginning of the piece (next to the clef).
Count the number of sharps (#) or flats (♭) in the key signature.
Use the table below to match the sharps or flats to their corresponding major and minor keys.

2. Determine if the Key is Major or Minor
Once you've identified the possible key from the key signature, decide whether the piece is in the major key or its relative minor.
Look for the raised seventh degree:
In minor keys, the seventh note of the scale is typically raised by a half step, creating a leading tone that resolves to the tonic. This is often indicated by an accidental (a sharp or natural sign not in the key signature).
For example:
If the key signature has no sharps or flats (C Major / A Minor), and you see a G♯ in the piece, the key is A Minor (G♯ is the raised seventh in A Minor).
If there are no such accidentals, the key is likely the major key.

3. Look for Other Clues
If you're unsure after checking the raised seventh, consider these additional hints:
Melodic and Harmonic Content:
Minor keys often emphasize minor triads (e.g., A-C-E for A Minor).
Look for chord progressions common to minor keys, such as i-iv-V-i (e.g., A Minor: Am-Dm-E-Am).
Starting and Ending Notes/Chords:
Many pieces start and end on the tonic note or chord of the key.
If a piece starts and ends on A Minor chords, it is likely in A Minor.

How to Determine an Unknown Time Signature: A Step-by-Step Guide
When you’re working with an unknown time signature, analyzing the rhythmic values and beat groupings is key. Follow these steps to determine the time signature:

Step 1: Identify the Beat Groupings
Look at the beamed notes (notes connected by beams). These groupings reveal how the beats are structured within the measure.
Add up the rhythmic values of all the notes under one beam to determine how much time they represent.

Step 2: Check the Total Value of the Beam Groupings
Determine whether the time is simple or compound based on the total rhythmic value of each grouping:
Simple Time
If the total value of a single beam grouping is 1, 2, or 0.5, you are in simple time.
In simple time:
Each beam grouping represents one beat.
The bottom number of the time signature is determined by the value of one beat:
If one beat = a quarter note (1), the bottom number is 4.
If one beat = an eighth note (0.5), the bottom number is 8.
If one beat = a half note (2), the bottom number is 2.
Compound Time
If the total value of a single beam grouping is 3, 1.5, or 0.75, you are in compound time.
In compound time:
Each beam grouping represents three smaller beats combined into one larger beat.
The value of one smaller beat determines the bottom number of the time signature:
If one smaller beat = a sixteenth note (0.25), the bottom number is 16.
If one smaller beat = an eighth note (0.5), the bottom number is 8.
If one smaller beat = a quarter note (1), the bottom number is 4.

Key Addition: Identify the Beat Value That Represents One Full Beat
To determine the bottom number, carefully analyze how the beats are grouped:
The bottom number represents the note value of one full beat, not necessarily the smallest rhythmic value in the measure.
For example:
If four sixteenth notes make up one beat, the bottom number would still be 4 (a quarter note) if the rhythm groups them into one quarter note.
Likewise, if two eighth notes form one beat, the bottom number would be 8.
This distinction is important because the time signature reflects the structural grouping of beats, not just the smallest subdivision present.

Step 3: Count the Total Beats in the Measure
Count the total number of smaller beats (the smallest note value corresponding to the bottom number of the time signature) in the measure.
This includes adding up all the rhythmic values in terms of the smallest beat (e.g., 16ths for a bottom number of 16, 8ths for a bottom number of 8).
In Simple Time:
Each beam grouping equals one beat. Add up the number of beats in the measure.
In Compound Time:
Each beam grouping equals three smaller beats. Add up the total number of smaller beats across all groupings.
The top number of the time signature is the total number of smaller beats in the measure.

Step 4: Write the Time Signature
Combine the top number (total number of smaller beats in the measure) with the bottom number (the note value for one smaller beat).
If the total number of smaller beats suggests simple time (e.g., grouped in twos or fours), write the time signature accordingly.
If the total number of smaller beats suggests compound time (e.g., grouped in threes), reflect that in the time signature.

Here are some examples:

Given Rhythmic Groupings
(16th, dotted 16th, 32nd)
(8th, 16th)
(16th, 16th, 16th)

Step 1: Analyze Each Beam Grouping
Group 1: 16th, dotted 16th, 32nd
A 16th note = 0.25 beats.
A dotted 16th note = 0.25 + 0.125 = 0.375 beats.
A 32nd note = 0.125 beats.
Total value = 0.25 + 0.375 + 0.125 = 0.75 beats.
Since the total is 0.75 beats, this grouping equals three 16th notes.

Group 2: Eighth, Sixteenth
An eighth note = 0.5 beats.
A sixteenth note = 0.25 beats.
Total value = 0.5 + 0.25 = 0.75 beats.
This grouping also equals three 16th notes.

Group 3: 16th, 16th, 16th
Each 16th note = 0.25 beats.
Total value = 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 = 0.75 beats.
This grouping equals three 16th notes as well.

Step 2: Determine the Bottom Number
Each smaller beat is a 16th note, so the bottom number of the time signature is 16.

Step 3: Count the Total Beats in the Measure
Count the total number of 16th notes in the measure. Each grouping equals three 16ths, and there are three groupings:
3 groupings × 3 16ths per grouping = 9 16ths total.
The top number of the time signature is therefore 9.

Step 4: Write the Time Signature
Combine the top number (total number of 16ths in the measure) with the bottom number (smallest beat value). The time signature is:
9/16

Final Answer
The time signature for the rhythm provided is 9/16, indicating a compound meter with three beats per measure, each divided into three 16th notes.

Example 2:

Given Rhythmic Groupings
(Dotted sixteenth, 32nd, eighth)
(Dotted eighth, sixteenth)

Step 1: Analyze Each Beam Grouping
Group 1: Dotted sixteenth, 32nd, eighth
A dotted sixteenth note = 3/32.
A 32nd note = 1/32.
An eighth note = 4/32.
Total value = 3/32 + 1/32 + 4/32 = 8/32 = 1/4.
This grouping equals 1/4 of a measure.

Group 2: Dotted eighth, sixteenth
A dotted eighth note = 3/16.
A sixteenth note = 1/16.
Total value = 3/16 + 1/16 = 4/16 = 1/4.
This grouping equals 1/4 of a measure.

Step 2: Add Up the Total Value of the Measure
Group 1 = 1/4.
Group 2 = 1/4.
Total = 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2.
The total rhythmic value of the measure is 1/2 of a whole note.

Step 3: Determine the Bottom Number
The measure adds up to 1/2 of a whole note, meaning the note value for 1 beat must be a quarter note (1/4). Thus, the bottom number of the time signature is 4.

Step 4: Count the Total Beats in the Measure
Each grouping equals 1/4 of a whole note, so there are 2 beats in the measure.
The top number of the time signature is 2, as there are 2 beats in the measure.

Step 5: Write the Time Signature
Combine the top number (2 beats) with the bottom number (4, representing a quarter note). The time signature is:
2/4

Final Answer
The time signature for the rhythm provided is 2/4, indicating 2 beats per measure, with each beat represented by a quarter note.

Last example:

Given Rhythmic Groupings
(Quarter, dotted quarter, eighth)
(16th, 16th, 8th, quarter, 8th, 8th)

Step 1: Analyze Each Beam Grouping
Group 1: Quarter, dotted quarter, eighth
A quarter note = 1 beat.
A dotted quarter note = 1.5 beats (3 eighths).
An eighth note = 0.5 beats.
Total value = 1 + 1.5 + 0.5 = 3 beats.
This grouping equals 3 beats.

Group 2: 16th, 16th, 8th, quarter, 8th, 8th
A 16th note = 0.25 beats (each).
An 8th note = 0.5 beats (each).
A quarter note = 1 beat.
Total value:
16th + 16th = 0.25 + 0.25 = 0.5
0.5 (eighth)
1 (quarter)
0.5 + 0.5 (two eighths)
Total = 0.5 + 0.5 + 1 + 0.5 + 0.5 = 3 beats.
This grouping also equals 3 beats.

Step 2: Add Up the Total Value of the Measure
Group 1 = 3 beats.
Group 2 = 3 beats.
Total = 3 + 3 = 6 beats.
The total value of the measure is 6 beats.

Step 3: Determine the Bottom Number
To find the bottom number, consider the note value of one beat. Since the rhythm is grouped into clear beats of 1 beat each, and a quarter note represents 1 beat, the bottom number of the time signature is 4.

Step 4: Count the Total Beats in the Measure
Since the measure contains 6 beats, the top number of the time signature is 6.

Step 5: Write the Time Signature
Combine the top number (6 beats) with the bottom number (quarter note as the beat unit). The time signature is:
6/4
